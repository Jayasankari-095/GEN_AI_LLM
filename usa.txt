Installments for business
Installments for consumers
Installments: Consumers can buy now and pay later
Offer your customers installment payment plans on an API-based solution or on existing international standards.
Stay informed
Introduction
Visa’s API model
Benefits
Visa has developed installment solutions
Visa has released capabilities on Visa Developer Portal to allow clients to develop and pilot installment experiences to offer to their customers.*
*Availability is subject to factors outside of Visa’s control, including participation by issuers, acquirers and merchants.
Introduction to installment payments
Installment payments (installments) refer to the option to pay for purchases over time by dividing the purchase amount into smaller equal payments. Consumers will typically use installments to buy medium and large ticket items (e.g. electronics, furniture). But in some markets, they may even use them to make everyday purchases (e.g. groceries, retail). So, what’s the key benefit for consumers with installments? They get to spread their purchases, including transparent fees, into periodic (usually monthly) repayment amounts.
The following example shows how installments payments work for a large ticket purchase of $800 paid for over 4 months, 0% fees:
Paid $200
1st installment
Paid $200
2nd installment
Paid $200
3rd installment
Paid $200
4th installment
Common installment payments models
There are two primary models in the global installment payments landscape: During Purchase and Post-Purchase. These models differ by when the consumer is offered installments, who presents the installment payments plan, and who pays for the cost of providing credit.*
*Financial institutions are solely responsible for its own installment program.
During purchase
Consumer prompted at merchant checkout to pay with installments

Post-purchase
Consumer converts a recent card transaction into installments
Create plan
API for issuers to create installment plans. Issuers to define plan attributes such as:
Duration of installment loan
Participating merchant and cards
Interest and fees
Check eligibility
API for acquirers, technology pltforms and merchant to look up eligible installment plan(s) for an installment transaction. Merchant can display eligible installment plans and costs to a cardholder during purchases.
Example: 6 month installment plan for all Visa Signature cards from Bank A at home appliance stores
Select plan
API for merchant to confirm the cardholder selected installment plan for a given transaction.
Convert plan
API for issuers to convert the original transaction into an installment plan.
Schedule plan
API for issuers to schedule payments of installment transactions The service will look up cardholder status and calculate monthly installment payments due, so that issuers can manage general ledger and post to cardholder statement correctly.
Visa’s installment solution can provide benefits for all parties in the ecosystem

Note: Depicts conceptual vision in development; features, functionality, availability are subject to change. Issuer is solely responsible for its own installment program.
Installments is a large and growing opportunity
Globally, installments represented $1.6T in market value in 2020. And it’s growing quickly - up 5% YoY. In contrast, credit card expenditure declined by 4% globally.
See image description
Global installments market size
Note: 2020 global installments market size ($1.6T) excludes $1.02T in untraceable installments volume (e.g., “debt consolidation”). Growth in global installments and credit cards shown as year-over-year increase in payments volume in 2019 vs. 2018.

If for any reason, Visa is not able to use the exchange rate from authorization for currency conversion, Visa will apply the exchange rate available at the time of the processing of the transaction. Your bank may or may not use the rate indicated by this calculator to bill you and may impose additional fees for foreign transactions. If your transaction is converted by the merchant or ATM operator, the exchange rate indicated by this calculator will not apply.

Find and support businesses in your community
Whether it is helping businesses impacted by wildfires, hurricanes, or other natural disasters, or identifying a place that accepts Visa credit or debit cards, we believe in using the power of Visa’s network to help support communities.
Use Visa’s Business search tool below to find and support businesses that have processed a Visa transaction in the past 24 hours.
Please note: Locator results help identify businesses that have recently processed a Visa transaction and are: (i) for informational purposes only; (ii) provided “as is”; and (iii) without any warranty or representation of any kind or any assurances that such businesses are open.
Find: business or category (optional)
Near: city or zip
×
Don't see your business?
If you are a business that’s open and accepting Visa transactions and not in this directory, let us know. Email your business name, street address, city and state, and business website, if available, to BacktoBusiness@Visa.com. Once we are able to verify the business meets Back to Business eligibility, we’ll work to get that business added.
Please note: All the information in this tool, which lists businesses identified by Visa to have recently accepted a Visa transaction, is provided “as is” and without any warranty or representation of any kind or any assurances that such businesses are open. For the small businesses, the information has been filtered for small businesses based on official Government tables (Small Business Administration or SBA guidelines) and users should communicate directly with merchants to verify accuracy. Results returned by this table are not to be considered an exhaustive list of merchants capable of providing services to an affected area and that other merchants may be in operation and serving an affected area. This tool is for informational purposes only, and does not imply endorsement or affiliation of any merchant by Visa. Visa assumes no liability or responsibility for (i) any errors or omissions in the content, or (ii) claims that may result from reliance by a user on such information.

Here are some other resources you might find useful:
California Wildfires SBA Disaster Assistance

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Small businesses often need more help
While Visa’s Business search tool helps identify all types of businesses that may be open, it was designed to focus on assisting small local businesses and communities prepare for, survive, and recover from natural disasters.
History of the project
Visa Back to Business was initially a small business recovery project that Visa launched after speaking with a small business owner in Houston, who was desperate to rebuild their business after Hurricane Harvey.

What are contactless payments?
Contactless payments are transactions made by tapping either a contactless card or payment-enabled mobile or wearable device over a contactless-enabled payment terminal. Cards, phones, watches and other devices use the same contactless technology.
Contactless payments can both improve your checkout experience and may also increase customer satisfaction and help boost store loyalty. Because your business engages directly with customers at the point-of-sale and in your marketing and advertising, you play a critical role in helping create a positive contactless payment experience.
Visa Contactless Cards
If your customer’s Visa card features the Contactless Indicator on either the front or back, they can use it to tap to pay where they see the Contactless Symbol at a merchant location.
Devices
Your customers can also tap to pay by loading an eligible payment card into a payment-enabled phone or wearable device.
How contactless payments can benefit your business

What should you do if you suspect a fraudulent charge
While Visa’s Zero Liability Policy protects you from unauthorized charges, it’s still important to stay vigilant about activity on your account.
Review your transactions
The best way to spot suspicious transactions is to stay on top of your account activity. Get in the habit of reviewing your monthly statements to quickly spot anything that seems off.
Report suspicious charges immediately
If you have identified suspicious charges, report them to your financial institution. It is important to report suspicious transactions in a timely manner.
Get quick resolution
Once an unauthorized transaction is reported, your financial institution will investigate so you can have the issue corrected quickly.
Important things to note
Visa's Zero Liability Policy requires issuers to replace funds taken from your account as the result of an unauthorized credit or debit transaction within five business days of notification. Visa’s Zero Liability Policy does not apply to certain commercial card and anonymous prepaid card transactions or transactions not processed by Visa.

  Online Privacy
When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or engage with our emails and online ads, we may collect information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs, and web beacons.
In some cases, the information we collect is only used in a non-identifiable way. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. We do not use this information to profile you or target our ads.
In other cases, we may use the information in an identifiable way. For example, we may authenticate you or your device, deliver personalized content or use the information for analytics, fraud detection, and security. We may also use the information for online ad targeting. Our Cookie Notice provides more information about our online data collection technologies and your choices. 
As described in our Cookie Notice, we have relationships with third-party advertising companies. These third parties may track you, your browser or your device across different websites and applications.
Subject to your settings, we may place cookies or tags on your computer when you visit our website so that they can display targeted advertisements to you on other websites. The use of your data by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies.
Many Visa websites only place marketing, personalization, and advertising cookies if you explicitly accept these cookies by clicking “Accept All Cookies” when you first visit the website. Our Cookie Notice explains how to manage your preferences and how to disable previously accepted cookies.
Our websites may enable you to interact with us and others via social media platforms. We collect information from these platforms as permitted by the sites’ legal terms.

However, where able, we will also provide you choices within the account profile section of the application.
We collect device identifiers and other device-related information, including your device’s advertising ID, if available. This information is used to identify your device and authenticate you. We may also use device-related information to associate you with different devices that you may use, including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target advertising.
