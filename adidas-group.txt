SUSTAINABILITY
MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
We are committed to steadily increasing the use of preferred fibers and are constantly exploring new, innovative materials to incorporate into our products.
We strive to create the best sporting goods. At the same time we want to reduce any potential impact this has on the planet. This is why we adopt increasingly more sustainable materials for making our products. We align our approach to more sustainable materials with internationally recognized industry definitions: “A fiber or raw material that delivers consistently reduced impacts and increased benefits for climate, nature, and people against the conventional equivalent, through a holistic approach to transforming production systems.”  
Find out more about our latest progress in our 2023 Annual Report
Besides transforming our portfolio to preferred fibers and materials, we are constantly exploring new innovative materials to incorporate into our products. Our approach is to be transparent about the materials we use, their environmental impact, and our efforts to mitigate any potential negative effects. Working with industry partners is essential to navigate this journey. (See Our Collaborations) 
In the following sections, we dive into the reasons behind our material choices, the effects they can have on the environment and people, and our approach to addressing potential impacts.
SYNTHETIC MATERIALS
NATURE-DERIVED MATERIALS
ANIMAL-DERIVED MATERIALS
PACKAGING
POLYESTER
WHY DO WE USE POLYESTER?
Polyester is the most commonly used material in our products due to its unique properties. Polyester allows us to build strong and lightweight materials that dry quickly and can be used in various applications, including football jerseys, outdoor jackets and training leggings. Polyester also blends well with natural fibers such as cotton, offering a perfect combination of performance and comfort. 
WHAT IS THE IMPACT?
We recognize the environmental impacts associated with virgin polyester. As a material derived from petroleum, its production involves energy and water consumption, as well as chemical-intensive processes that contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions. 
OUR APPROACH
In 2017, we set ourselves the ambitious target to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all products where a solution exists by the end of 2024. We set clear internal milestones for our product creation teams and have seen progress over the last several seasons. In 2023, 99% (2022: 96%) of all the polyester we used was recycled. With that, we are on track to use only recycled polyester by the end of 2024. While recycled polyester has been in use for a long time, it is still not the standard in the textile industry, with only 15% of polyester produced worldwide being recycled polyester.

Recycled polyester is a better alternative to virgin polyester as it uses existing material as feedstock and has an overall significantly lower environmental impact. Currently, we derive recycled polyester from recycled plastic bottles, with the aim of transitioning to recycled polyester from textile fiber-to-fiber recycling. Fiber-to-fiber recycling is currently in the early stages of development, we are, however, actively working with innovative recyclers to advance this technology and expect it to scale in the next decade. 
To ensure the integrity of our recycled materials, we work closely with our supply chain partners, using certifications from reputable third-party certifications such as the Global Recycled Standard (GRS) and the Recycled Claim Standard (RCS). These certifications guarantee robust chain of custody and minimize the risks of unauthorized mixing or swapping of materials. 
ELASTIC POLYMERS
WHY DO WE USE ELASTIC POLYMERS? 
Elastic polymers, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), and elastane, play essential roles in our products. An EVA footwear sole offers numerous advantages, as it is lightweight and flexible, making it an ideal choice for shoe bases. Elastane, also known as Lycra, is a crucial material in our products, providing stretch and allowing garments and trims to fit snugly while enabling freedom of movement. These elastic polymers contribute to our products' comfort, functionality, and longevity. 
WHAT IS THE IMPACT? 
The production of elastic polymers relies on petroleum-based inputs and is associated with energy-, water-, and chemical-intensive production processes that can contribute to the increase of resource depletion and global greenhouse gas emissions. 
OUR APPROACH 
We are already using EVA materials that contain recycled content. However, there are still many limitations that impact the performance of such materials. This is why we also work on finding alternatives that replace petroleum-based inputs with renewable ones, like bio-based EVA which use plant-based content derived from sugar cane or corn.
POLYAMIDES 
WHY DO WE USE POLYAMIDES? 
Polyamide fabric is highly versatile due to various finishing processes that can be applied. Nylon, the most common type of polyamide, offers exceptional performance qualities such as strength, stretch and moisture-wicking properties. Polyamides like nylon are used in a wide range of products, for example for adidas training leggings.  
WHAT IS THE IMPACT? 
The production of polyamides relies on petroleum-based inputs and is associated with energy-, water-, and chemical-intensive production processes that can contribute to the increase of resource depletion and global greenhouse gas emissions. 
OUR APPROACH  
We are already using recycled polyamides in many products. At the same time, we recognize the need for better alternatives that can replace fossil-fuel-derived polyamides. Our goal is to adopt these alternatives as soon as they become commercially viable, ensuring that they meet the high product performance standards expected by our consumers.

LEADERSHIP
If you want to evolve the culture of any company or team, you need to start with leadership. Leaders at adidas act as role models, empowering all people to realize their possibilities. It’s important to grow all employees to act as leaders and all people managers to empower their teams so that everyone can realize their possibilities in our company. However, it is important to note that we are not only talking about line managers with direct reports. This is relevant for everyone. We all have the ability to role model and inspire by taking ownership, showing courage and driving innovation to make a real impact on our company.
Our ambition is to inspire and nurture talented and diverse leaders who exemplify our leadership behaviors while our development offerings focus on developing the leadership behaviors and essential skills needed to ensure our continued success. We undertake different initiatives to elevate and enhance our leadership pipeline:
Leadership development experiences: Our portfolio of leadership development experiences is designed for every level of management across all markets and functions. They include our ‘People Leader Experience’ (‘PLE’), ‘Manager Development Experience’ (‘MDE’), ‘Director Development Experience’ (‘DDE’), and ‘Executive Development Experience’ (‘EDE’). These interactive learning experiences support the development of leadership skills that are directly linked to the participants’ current roles and responsibilities as well as being aligned to our values.
Leadership groups: Our leadership groups consist of the ‘Core Leadership Group’ (CLG) and the ‘Extended Leadership Group’ (ELG). The CLG partners with the Executive Board, leading the execution of our business strategy while the ELG collaborates across markets and functions, leading the execution of our strategic initiatives. Furthermore, the ELG drives continuous improvement and consistency throughout the organization.
High-potential programs: We invest in selected high-performing and high-potential employees through three dedicated programs: ‘Global High Potential Group’ (GHIPO), ‘Local High Potential Group’ (LHIPO), and ‘Future High Potential Group’ (FHIPO) program. Our ‘GHIPO’ and ‘LHIPO’ programs enable us to identify and develop global and local high-potential leaders who have the ability to take on more complex and demanding responsibilities at a higher leadership level. The programs are designed to build peer relationships and to give participants cross-functional and cross-cultural exposure. The ‘FHIPO’ program enables us to identify and develop selected high-potential employees at an early stage in their careers. The program is designed to build on participants’ skills, further evolve their capabilities, strengthen their behaviors, and expand their business perspective.
BETTERMENT THROUGH LEARNING
We continue to promote a high-performance culture by developing our employees. We offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities, including online learning resources and interactive learning experiences that provide personal and professional growth opportunities for our workforce. Our investments in digital learning and development opportunities, such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, Circus Street, and Arizona State University, offer equitable access to learning content and just-in-time upskilling and/or reskilling.
The key pillars of our extended learning and development offerings are informal learning and mentoring. Our informal learning is supported by platforms where employees can network and connect across the organization based on shared learning goals and/or interests.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT AT ADIDAS
At adidas, we are committed to driving development opportunities for all our employees. Find out how we’re taking this to heart.
LEARN MORE
PERFORMANCE
The key focus of our rewards strategy is to attract, retain, and motivate individuals through remuneration and benefits that are inclusive, fit for purpose, and competitive in the marketplace – thus enabling us to achieve our strategic objectives. To promote a high-performance culture, it is essential that we focus on performance management to ensure fair and equitable reward and recognition.
Performance management: #MYBEST is our global performance development approach and a key enabler of our high-performance culture. #MYBEST has three elements to encourage regular high-quality conversations between employee and line manager, and to ensure goals are set and reviewed quarterly. A formal performance evaluation takes place twice a year, with employee development being the focus of every monthly ‘Touch Base’ conversation. We continue to work on making the performance evaluation and potential assessment processes more equitable and to further develop our line managers’ capabilities to engage in meaningful performance standard conversations. As we implement the new values into #MYBEST in 2023, we will focus on the adoption of these values and how they are lived.
Total compensation management: Compensation at adidas has a dual focus of ensuring employees are compensated fairly and equitably for the role they perform, while also creating a culture of rewarding performance. The adidas total compensation management philosophy enables educated compensation decisions based on external market reference and internal equity. It also takes into account the skills, experience, and responsibility of each individual. Our variable compensation programs engage and motivate employees by reflecting their activities’ input, while driving a culture of high-performance. To do this, adidas offers the following variable compensation plans: 
Short-Term Incentive program, 
Profit participation programs, 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for senior management.
Benefits: At adidas, employee benefits take the form of monetary or non-monetary programs that supplement wages or salaries on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Programs can be offered globally, regionally, or locally and can be statutory or supplemental. They comply with legislation or local market practice and are based on benchmark data.
Cross-border employment: adidas invests in international relocation to fill local skill gaps, enable knowledge transfer, develop talent for a more diverse workforce, enable location strategy, and enforce our learning culture. Our aim is to support the success of our business through a relocation of talent that will both enhance the employee experience and align with our business purpose.
Stock Purchase Plan: Participation in the Stock Purchase Plan is open to employees in Germany, the US, the Netherlands, and Greater China (China mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). This amounts to access for almost half our global workforce (excluding Retail).

PRODUCT AND CONSUMER SAFETY
Product safety and consumer-safe products are of highest importance to adidas.
Product safety is an imperative. As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products that may result in injury to consumers and/or impair our image. To mitigate this risk, we have company-wide product safety policies in place that ensure we consistently apply physical, chemical product safety and conformity standards across all brands of the company. To ensure product quality and consumer-safe products, all materials and product samples have to pass a rigid compliance process and are tested in accordance with standardised material and product testing specifications and procedures. 
Dedicated teams monitor the quality of our products on all levels of the supply chain through rigorous testing prior to production, close cooperation with suppliers throughout the manufacturing process, random testing after retail delivery, open communication about defective products and quick settlement of product liability claims when necessary.
Besides ensuring safe and environmentally sound products within our core product ranges, we constantly monitor and educate branded product areas that may have special risk profiles. These areas range from promotional items with bioactive textiles (ones that can interact with living organisms) to personal protective equipment, electronic devices and children’s and babies’ clothing. We constantly track legal developments in the area of product safety and, where necessary, update our policies and manuals, as we have done in the area of children’s clothing.

WORKERS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
Workers in our suppliers’ factories play a central role in our sustainability program.
It was our concern for the well-being of workers in our factories that led us to establish our "Workplace Standards," the supply chain code of conduct, which covers workers’ health and safety and provisions to ensure environmentally sound factory operations. A number of topics related to the workers' well-being are of special interest to our stakeholders. These range from fair wages, child labor and freedom of association to health and safety.

DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE
Once a year, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of adidas AG issue a declaration of compliance pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act.
The German Corporate Governance Code provides guidelines for the management and supervision of German listed companies and contains internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and responsible governance. The German Corporate Governance Code aims at promoting the trust of shareholders, business partners, employees, and the general public in the management of German stock corporations.
The principles of good corporate governance inform every part of our organization and we comply with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code with a few exceptions.

DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE 2024
Declaration of the adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board regarding the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG)
The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board issued their last Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to § 161 AktG in December 2023. The following declaration refers to the recommendations of the ‘Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code’ in the version of April 28, 2022, published in the Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022 (‘Code’).
The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board declare that since the publication of their last Declaration of Compliance in December 2023, the recommendations of the Code have been and are met with the following exceptions:
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 1
One member of the Supervisory Board, Ian Gallienne, holds more than two mandates in supervisory bodies of non-group companies which are listed at a stock exchange or have similar requirements. Ian Gallienne is Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (‘GBL’). GBL is a holding company that is regularly represented in the supervisory bodies of portfolio companies as an institutional investor, inter alia, by its Chief Executive Officer. All companies (apart from adidas AG) in which Ian Gallienne is a member of the supervisory body are portfolio companies or subsidiaries of GBL or are under joint control of GBL and therefore belong to the same group of companies. They have to be attributed to his main occupation as Chief Executive Officer of GBL.
We are of the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, recommendation C.5 alternative 1 of the Code is thus not applicable to Ian Gallienne. For precautionary reasons, however, a deviation is declared. The Supervisory Board has also assured itself that Ian Gallienne has sufficient time to duly perform his duties as a member of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG.
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 2
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Thomas Rabe, is also Chief Executive Officer of the listed company RTL Group S.A., Luxembourg. In this respect, the company deviates from recommendation C.5 alternative 2 of the Code. However, the Supervisory Board is convinced that Thomas Rabe’s mandate at RTL Group S.A. does not affect the due performance of his duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In particular, the Supervisory Board has assured itself that Thomas Rabe has sufficient time to perform his duties.
Herzogenaurach, December 2024

For the Executive Board                            For the Supervisory Board
– Chief Executive Officer –                        – Chairman of the Supervisory Board –

adidas continuously receives positive recognition from international institutions, rating agencies, NGOs, and socially responsible investment analysts for its holistic approach to managing sustainability.

STRATEGY
With sport playing an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, both on and off the field of play, we operate in a highly attractive industry. Based on the authenticity of the adidas brand and our constant efforts to understand our consumers’ needs, we aim at capitalizing on the acceleration of favorable long-term structural trends by pushing the boundaries of products, experiences, and services.
Since the creation and launch of our ‘Own the Game’ strategy, the economic and political environment we operate in has significantly changed. Macroeconomic challenges as well as geopolitical tensions have had an adverse impact on our business, our consumers, and business partners. Paving the way for a restart, Bjørn Gulden joined adidas as new CEO in January 2023. In this context, we are currently conducting a thorough strategic review, which also includes the financial ambition for 2025.

MANAGERS' TRANSACTIONS
Notifications concerning transactions by persons purs. to Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation
Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”), sets out statutory regulations with regard to managers’ transactions of persons discharging managerial responsibilities at an issuer of financial instruments as well as of persons closely associated with them.
Closely associated persons are the spouse, registered partner, dependent children and any other relatives with whom the person discharging managerial responsibilities has lived in the same household for at least one year at the time of conclusion of the respective transaction, and under certain conditions legal persons, trusts or partnerships.
Under MAR, the persons concerned are obligated to notify the respective transaction upon conclusion to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, “BaFin”) and the respective issuer.
Transactions must be notified once they exceed the threshold of EUR 20,000.00 in a calendar year. It is not required that earlier transactions which were initially beneath the threshold be notified subsequently.
The template, the use of which is mandatory for all notifications, requires, i.a., that the following data be published:
Details of the persons discharging managerial responsibilities/persons closely associated with them
Reason for the notification
Details of the issuer
Details of the transaction (price, nature/volume)

PEOPLE & CULTURE
OUR COMMUNITIES
Our community engagement is fully aligned with our overall purpose.
As a global sports company we believe that through sport, we have the power to change lives. Through our community engagement efforts, we put this purpose into action. Powered by our brand attitude ‘Impossible Is Nothing’ we aim to create social impact for our communities.  
Through charitable contributions, volunteering and knowledge sharing, we work hand-in-hand with local organizations in key cities, key sourcing locations and key markets to bring our purpose to life. Anchored in two pillars, ‘People’ and ‘Planet’, we aim to achieve the overarching goal of shaping a better future for everyone using sport as a positive vehicle of change.  
People: We drive access to sport for everyone and create an equal and safe environment for all when doing sport.   
Planet: We take action to end plastic waste by protecting the spaces we live and play in. We support sustainable and environmental initiatives that drive change and create real impact.  
Relief presents an additional social and humanitarian component to our efforts. As natural disasters and other crises can strike at any moment, adidas stands with its communities in the markets, cities and sourcing locations in challenging times.  
Our charitable giving guidelines support us in implementing our strategic priorities and adhering to our principles for social initiatives. To ensure that our community engagement efforts land with sustained impact, we thoroughly measure, track, and evaluate our social impact.
OUR ENGAGEMENT 
We strategically select projects and long-term partnerships that create social value and the impact needed to drive positive change most effectively – ranging from skill-based employee volunteering, financial/ in-kind donations to expert advice, grants and sponsoring.   
We give back: To maximize our positive impact, we create volunteer programs and company-matched fundraisers that encourage employees to actively engage and bring our core belief to life. Teams in all markets take part in multi-faceted volunteering initiatives, with projects ranging from sports coaching in safe places for women and girls to providing skills-based support to refugees to help them unlock their potential in the labor market. By continuously running fundraising campaigns that match employee donations, adidas continues to demonstrate our collective and united support as one adidas family.
We reduce product waste: As a sporting goods company, we have a responsibility for our planet. We do not want our products going to landfill, but rather give them a second life. While reducing waste, we also have the opportunity to create positive change by supporting communities in need with our products. Our product donations are supported by long-term partner organizations such as the Global Aid Network (GAiN) and Ora Kinderhilfe to ensure products are fairly distributed to create real change. 
We stand up for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We want to make sport accessible, equitable, and safe for all. By championing individual uniqueness and cultivating a culture of belonging, we work together with expert organizations and local communities to create lasting change. Through programs such as TeamPride to support the LGBTQIA2+ community, United Against Racism to stand with people of color, or Breaking Barriers to engage more girls in sport, we create an environment in which everyone feels valued, recognized, rewarded, and is given the opportunity to perform at their best. 
We cooperate for change: Grassroots football is not only where the stars of tomorrow are made - Grassroots clubs are support systems for their local communities and they are under threat. adidas Football Collective and UEFA Champions League are championing grassroots football, so tomorrow’s stars can thrive.   
We build infrastructure for change:  By building infrastructure such as playgrounds and sports courts, we provide access to sports for communities around the world. For example, we've partnered with athletes like David Alaba to build a football pitch in his hometown of Vienna, Austria,  to create a space where people of all backgrounds can come together to enjoy the game of football. And with our partner, the US Soccer Foundation, we built more than 100 mini-pitches across North America to improve access to football and use the sport to transform and improve the lives of children in underserved communities.
We protect our planet: Our holistic approach to sustainability responds to the challenges that endanger our planet and people. Our activities range from awareness raising campaigns to collaborations with partners such as Parley for the Oceans to inspire action to fight plastic waste. Over the past few years, we have proved our commitment to saving the oceans in our annual Run for the Oceans events. In 2022, it became the biggest virtual running event in the history of adidas. For every 10 active minutes logged, we supported our partner Parley’s Global Cleanup Network to remove plastic waste (up to 250.000kg) from beaches and islands.

ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Engaging openly with stakeholders and establishing leadership approaches for transparency and disclosure is a fundamental part of our approach to sustainability.
AT ADIDAS, WE ARE DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION
We consider sustainability to be a cross-functional team effort that requires a solid governance structure. The head of Sustainability at adidas is responsible for the development and execution of our sustainability strategy and reports to the Executive Board member responsible for Global Operations. They also lead the Sustainability Sponsor Board, which is composed of senior representatives from all relevant functions across the company, including Global Brands, Digital, and Global Sales. The members of the Sponsor Board ensure cross-functional alignment and transparent end-to-end management of goals within their function.  
We have set up regular sustainability networking calls for all employees involved in sustainability projects and programs to ensure company-wide alignment on all levels. On top of this, adidas has developed a company-wide sustainability training program available to all employees, educating them on how to think and act sustainably. This enables them to become sustainability ambassadors and encourages them to make personal and professional commitments that will contribute to a cleaner planet. We have also initiated a sustainability training program for our retail colleagues, with the objective of informing, engaging, and inspiring our entire team and, by extension, the consumers they interact with on a daily basis.

SUSTAINABILITY
BIODIVERSITY
Managing the impact on biodiversity and nature along the entire value chain is a key focus of our work in the area of sustainability. We continue to address water efficiency, water quality, and chemical management in dedicated programs and rely on holistic frameworks such as Science-based Targets for Nature to guide our strategy.
adidas is aware of the potential impact its business operations can have on ecosystems, disrupting our supply chains connected to nature-derived materials, compromising landscapes and ecosystem services, and influencing the future of the textile industry. At the same time, we believe that maintaining and preserving biodiversity is a complex challenge that requires systemic change and strong collaboration among multiple actors, including suppliers, certifiers, innovators, and partners. As a signatory of the Fashion Pact, we have committed to set specific targets and action plans to decrease our impact on biodiversity.
In 2023, we continued to assess and better understand where exactly our impacts lie and started to formulate our approach to managing biodiversity challenges in our value chain. A particular focus was given to the potential risk of deforestation, as this represents the greatest lever for reducing the loss of biodiversity. In our value chain, a potential risk of deforestation is linked to the sourcing of nature-derived commodities used in our products and packaging, such as leather, natural rubber, and timber. Following scientifically validated frameworks provided by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) and the Accountability Framework Initiative (AFI), we identified first concrete actions to be taken across our entire value chain, such as mapping our supply chain beyond our Tier 3 suppliers and setting time-bound commitments for deforestation-free supply chains.
In 2023, we prioritized leather and have already set such a target. Roadmaps for natural rubber and timber-derived materials are under development.
LEATHER
adidas was one of the pioneers to commit to sourcing all bovine leather from deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) supply chains by 2030 or earlier. This commitment is based on the ‘Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather’ by Textile Exchange and the Leather Working Group (‘LWG’), which aims to catalyze change within the entire bovine leather value chain through collective action. To achieve the 2030 target, we will follow a two-phase roadmap. The first phase encompasses mapping the leather supply chain beyond the tannery to the origin of the hide at the slaughterhouse. This additional transparency will allow a risk assessment and, in a second phase, lead to more specific requirements for the earlier production stages to ensure that the leather we source is not linked to deforestation. For more information about this commitment, see here.
In 2023, we started a comprehensive mapping of our entire leather supply ecosystem down to the slaughterhouse and, where possible, to the farm level. This assessment was carried out with the support of an external party and is currently under evaluation. Our next steps will be based on this mapping. The strong collaboration with our strategic suppliers plus our traceability expertise give adidas the confidence to pave the way toward a DCF supply chain. 
Traceability is a key aspect to achieve our DCF targets. We are therefore supporting various initiatives that are working on creating scalable traceability solutions for the leather supply chain, such as the LWG ‘Traceability Roadmap,’ which is targeted at producing a model for deforestation due diligence and chain of custody. We are also sponsoring the first phase of the COTI (Certification of Origin and Traceability Implementation Initiative), which aims to enable traceability for social and environmental compliance from farming to slaughterhouse, including indirect farming systems in the state of Pará, Brazil. In addition, adidas piloted a traceability blueprint for leather footwear using blockchain technology with the UN Economic Commission for Europe.
TIMBER-RELATED COMMODITIES AND ALTERNATIVES
To address the challenges in our supply chain related to timber-derived materials, adidas has partnered with Canopy to help protect ancient and endangered forests through the CanopyStyle and Pack4Good initiatives. adidas is committed to:
assessing our use of man-made cellulosic fibers (MMCF), timber-derived packaging, and paper, and setting interim targets to eliminate sourcing from endangered species habitat and ancient and endangered forests, while working to eliminate sourcing from companies that are logging forests illegally,
developing a strategy with targets and timelines for the reduction and reuse of timber-derived packaging by end of 2025,
exploring alternative Next Gen fibers as part of a commitment to innovative and more sustainable materials,
working with Canopy and adidas’ strategic suppliers to support collaborative and visionary solutions that aim to protect remaining ancient and endangered forests.
NATURAL RUBBER
Concerning natural rubber, adidas has also initiated a supply chain mapping exercise to identify the countries of origin of this feedstock and all actors involved. The gaps identified in this analysis will be addressed over the next few years to ensure we have full visibility of our supply chain and to enable us to work with our suppliers toward our goal of sourcing DCF natural rubber.
SUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING
We have also gone beyond the scope of understanding the impact of raw materials and have assessed our own and strategic suppliers’ operations against proximity to biodiversity-sensitive and water risk areas, using internationally recognized tools such as the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR), and Aqueduct (data platform run by the World Resources Institute using open-source, peer reviewed data to map water risks such as floods, droughts and stress).
 We are closely monitoring the further development of the Science-based Targets for Nature framework and intend to apply it to guide our next steps when it is ready.

ADIDAS FAIR PLAY CODE OF CONDUCT
Fair Play is the Rule of our Game!
Our mission is clear: We want to be the best sports brand in the world. To achieve this, we need to uphold and strengthen our brands' connection to fair play and integrity.
Both in sport and in business, players need to be able to have trust in Fair Play and the integrity of their partners. This requires that players choose to comply with common rules and have the ability to make decisions that comply with these rules.
From the Executive Board to our stores, every employee is responsible for Fair Play. We believe in making the right decisions even when nobody is watching. We do not believe in cutting corners or even associating ourselves with those who do.
The Fair Play Code of Conduct describes how we put this into practice every day at work and how we live up to our values.

ADR PROGRAM
adidas AG American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)
An American Depositary Receipt (ADR) is a receipt representing ordinary or common shares of a non-US company. ADRs are priced in US dollars and traded on US exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares of non-US companies in exactly the same way as they purchase or sell shares of US companies.
adidas AG ADRs, with the ticker symbol 'ADDYY,' are dollar-denominated securities backed by the shares trading in Germany. The ratio between the ADR and the underlying ordinary shares is 2:1, meaning that two adidas AG ADRs are the equivalent of one adidas AG ordinary share.
 
In the United States, adidas AG ADRs are traded on the OTCQX International Premier market, the highest over-the-counter market tier provided by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Trading information is readily available on the OTCQX website at www.otcmarkets.com.
 
The adidas AG ADR Program is a sponsored Level I ADR Program run by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank).

INCLUSION & CULTURE
People & Culture
We strongly believe that embedding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into our culture and talent processes gives our employees a sense of belonging and our brand a real competitive advantage. By recruiting talent and developing our people to reflect the rich diversity of our consumers and communities, we foster a culture of inclusion that engages our employees and authentically connects our brand with our consumers. 
Our DEI strategy, ‘Creating an Equal Playing Field for All,’ is based on three key pillars: people, culture, and accountability.

KEY FACTS
Ambition to reach gender balance in leadership by 2033
33 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) representing 7 diversity dimensions
DEI STRATEGY
PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABILITY
CULTURE
The people pillar focuses on closing talent gaps by attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent through a commitment to inclusion for all employees.
As part of the people pillar, we’ve set ourselves a measurable and aspirational goal to help us realize our ambitions: to achieve gender balance in leadership (director level and above) globally by 2033.
At adidas, we fully embrace the power of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) – employee-led networks that build communities and foster greater connection and understanding among employees across all backgrounds. We have over 30 ERGs around the globe, as well as diversity ambassador teams that focus on seven diversity dimensions.
EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS
Our Employee Resource Groups serve as a vital forum for addressing challenges and promoting inclusivity within our organization. 
GENDER IDENTITY
Our Women's Network and the Gender Equity Network focus on promoting gender balance and addressing the barriers faced by women in the workplace.
VETERAN STATUS
VetNet acknowledges the unique experiences of military veterans in the U.S., providing a community that understands and respects their service and sacrifices.
RACE & ETHNICITY
Groups such as United Voices, Progressive Soles, and the Diversity Collective bring together and support employees from diverse backgrounds.
ABILITIES
Our World of Abilities group is dedicated to raising awareness about the challenges surrounding disabilities. 
GENERATION, LIFE & EXPERIENCE
The Xperienced Generation raises awareness of age-related topics, while the Caregivers ERG supports those balancing work and family responsibilities.
SEXUAL ORIENTATION
Our commitment to the LGBTQIA2S+ community is reflected in our Proud2Play group, which promotes inclusivity and acceptance regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
FAITH & CULTURE
Communities like Bless Up and the Jewish Group aim to promote awareness, understanding, and respect for different beliefs, practices, and celebrations.

HISTORY
We started in a laundry room and conquered the world. And in between, we’ve scored big and sometimes struggled to reach our goals. We’ve done our best for the best. We’ve improved and grown. Looking ahead to the future, always remembering where we came from. This is our story.

THE EARLY YEARS
Every great story has a beginning. This one starts in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After starting out in his mother’s laundry room, Adi Dassler and his brother register the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’ in 1924 and Adi embarks on his mission to provide athletes with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam (1928), Los Angeles (1932) and Berlin (1936) are the first rewards and milestones – and only the start of our story.

FOUNDING FATHER
On August 18, 1949, Adi Dassler starts a new chapter at the age of 49, registering the ‘Adolf Dassler adidas Sportschuhfabrik’ and setting to work with 47 employees in the small town of Herzogenaurach. In the same year, he registers a shoe that features  the soon-to-become-famous adidas 3-Stripes. From humble beginnings to a global success story – accelerated by a miracle (but more on that later)…
A FOOTBALL BOOT WITH A STYLISH FUTURE
Weighing in at 357 grams, the first Samba looks very different to the streetwear icon we know and love today. Launched in 1950, the shoe is originally created as a football boot for icy and snowy pitches. Fast forward to today and the shoe has gone through quite the transformation, becoming one of the coolest kicks off the pitch.
In 1972, the Samba as we know it today is launched. Still worn as a football shoe, its 3-zone profile offers unparalleled agility and multidirectional grip, perfect for fast-paced football action. As the 90s dawn, the Samba is embraced by the fashion set, soon becoming a style icon with a bright future on the feet of today’s trendsetters.
A MIRACLE IN BERN
Who would have thought that screw-in studs on lightweight football boots would help write history? When the German national football team face the unbeatable Hungarians in the 1954 World Cup final, they win so much more than just a trophy. Their unbelievable victory would be heard around the world for decades to come; and it makes adidas and its founder a household name on football pitches everywhere.
The revolutionary boots get a lot of attention internationally, with critics highlighting the boot’s lightweight design and adaptable screw-in studs.
Adi Dassler is seen here in 1954 working on the boots and screw-in studs.
Adi Dassler prided himself on providing only the best for the athlete, personally ensuring equipment was up to his high standards.
BONJOUR ADIDAS FRANCE
Adi Dassler’s son, Horst, is tasked with opening a new production facility in France, with the goal of using the established shoe-making industry in the country, to make shoes at a more competitive price. Horst is just 23-years old at the time, but he’s eager to step up to the plate. In doing so, he lays the groundwork for adidas France.
PRODUCTION ON HOME SOIL
In the same year, the adidas Scheinfeld factory opens in Germany, close to the adidas HQ in Herzogenaurach. The factory is still in operation today and continues to produce shoe models, including the Copa Mundial.
THE FIRST TRACKSUIT
What’s in a name? Everything, especially when you name it after a “Kaiser”. When the Franz Beckenbauer tracksuit model celebrates its debut, it becomes the first piece of apparel for adidas and opens a whole new business to a company that, so far, is famous for shoes. Since 1967, the adidas tracksuit has seen many iterations and interpretations, but has often returned to the original influences of the Franz Beckenbauer. Read more about the history of tracksuits here.
ONLY THE BEST FOR THE ATHLETE
How do you consistently earn the trust of world-class athletes through the decades? Produce innovative products that make them even better. Adi Dassler’s secret to success has an additional personal ingredient: He meets with athletes (some of them even as visitors in Herzogenaurach), listens carefully to what they say, and constantly observes what can be improved or even invented to support their needs. The best of the best trust adidas and its founder from the beginning. And this does not change throughout the decades to come. 
Bob Beamon set a world record in long jump in adidas shoes.
Rod Laver winning grand slams in adidas shoes.
When Dick Fosbury made his mark with a totally new high-jumping technique, he was supported by adidas shoes that coped with the new requirements.
ONE BALL FOR ALL
Footwear for gold medal winners? Check. Now, how about something to kick around during the world’s biggest tournament? Consider it done. In 1970, adidas delivers the official ball, TELSTAR, for the 1970 FIFA World Cup™ for the first time. As the name TELSTAR already indicates, the ball is designed to improve visibility on black and white television.  It signifies the beginning of a wonderful partnership, with adidas providing the official match ball for every FIFA World Cup™. Since 1970, each adidas World Cup match ball showcases significant refinements to its predecessor – both technically and aesthetically. Read more on the history of World Cup match balls here.
THE TREFOIL IS BORN
In 1972, adidas presents a new logo that was here to stay: the Trefoil. Then, symbolizing performance. Today, the adidas Originals collection stands for lifestyle and streetwear inspired by sport and the culture born from it. Times may change, but the trefoiled quality will always remain.
BECOMING A TRUE MULTI-SPORTS SPECIALIST
From Herzogenaurach to the rest of the world: the 3-Stripes keep expanding to more and more sports throughout the years. This is reflected in the broad range of athletes who trust adidas to make them better. Besides the usual suspects, such as the world’s best football players – like the Argentinean national team – gymnast Nadia Comaneci scores a perfect 10, repeatedly.
adidas expanded its portfolio of sports early on ... to gymnastics, for example. Nadia Comaneci scored a perfect 10 with adidas equipment repeatedly.
Football has always been at the core of adidas' efforts and adidas always had the trust of the best of the best, like the Argentinian national team.
A partnership with Stan Smith, seen here during his 1972 Wimbledon victory, signaled the start of a 50+ year relationship between adidas and the tennis icon.
“PEOPLE THINK I’M A SHOE”
Close your eyes and think of a classic white sneaker. For many people, it looks something like this: A sleek, timeless, lace-up design with an off-white sole and a pop of green shading on the heel cap and tongue. Synonymous with classic style, an everyday staple of footwear history, the Stan Smith shoe, which launched in 1973, is a true sportswear icon, but did you know it started life as a tennis shoe, named after one of the sport’s biggest stars.
The Stan Smith is originally developed with a French player in the mid-60s. In 1973, the first shoes featuring Stan’s name are released and by the 1980s, the shoe’s popularity was taking off beyond the tennis court. By 1989, adidas and Stan Smith make their way into the Guinness Book of Records after selling a staggering 22 million pairs. Read more about the history of the Stan Smith shoe here.
DEATH OF A SHOEMAKER
Adi Dassler dies on September 6, shortly before his 78th birthday. The man who almost single-handedly redefined the sporting goods industry and lifted the benchmark by a mile, leaves behind a flourishing company. Yet, the end of one Dassler era became the start of another: Adi’s wife, Käthe, with support from her son Horst, takes over.
A FOOTBALL BOOT FOR THE WORLD
Designed for the 1982 FIFA World Cup™ in Spain, the Copa Mundial (Spanish for ‘World Cup’) goes on to become adidas’ most-produced football boot of all time. Made in Germany, the shoe is still produced at the Scheinfeld factory, which is close to the adidas HQ. The shoe’s timeless design makes it a beloved boot for amateurs and professionals alike. Formfitting and with a soleplate durable enough to endure multiple seasons, the Copa Mundial has seen many iterations since the ‘80s, each paying tribute to the original classic.
A COMPUTER FOR YOUR FEET
It sounds quite common today, but back in the ‘80s, a computer did not belong, much less fit, in your shoe; that didn’t stop adidas from putting one in there. An innovation ahead of its time, the Micropacer, features a system that provides performance statistics to athletes.
WHEN STREET CULTURE MEETS SPORTS CULTURE
When US-based hip-hop group Run-D.M.C. released “My Adidas,” it set the record straight about youth culture, their passions, and pure enthusiasm about their sneakers. adidas itself only finds out about this love story when the band hold up the 3-Stripes shoes during a concert in front of 40,000 fans – one of these concertgoers is an adidas employee. The song becomes a hit and Run-D.M.C. and adidas unexpectedly find themselves in a unique partnership. This moment signifies the birth of non-athletic promotions in the sporting goods industry.
And the shoe that started it all? Well, that was the Superstar. Originally launched in 1970, it wasn’t until Run-D.M.C removed the laces and penned their famous song, that the Superstar name was cemented in history as an icon on the streets.
Did you know the Supergrip was the predecessor to the Superstar? First developed in the 1960s, it is the first low-top leather basketball shoe. By the 1970s, the Superstar arrives on the scene with its iconic feature: the shell toe. Take a trip back in time and learn more about the history of the Superstar here.
ADIDAS BECOMES A STOCK CORPORATION
Horst Dassler’s sudden death in 1987, three years after his mother, Käthe, passed away, means troubled waters for adidas. In 1989, adidas becomes a stock corporation and Adi Dassler's daughters sell their shares in 1990. After Adi Dassler’s daughters exit the company, the change in leadership and questionable strategic decisions cause a record loss in 1992 and bring the company close to bankruptcy. But who doesn’t love a comeback story?
A SYSTEMATIC SHIFT FOR RUNNING
adidas introduces the Torsion System, and in doing so, takes running innovation to the next level by allowing for more natural foot movement. Offering greater stability and a strong push-off during an athlete’s foot stride, the Torsion Bar at the midfoot prevents the shoe from bending under the arch of the foot.
The Torsion System was first featured in the ZX franchise in the late ‘80s. The system continued to evolve, and an updated version of it was later incorporated in the first Boost shoe in 2013 – once again becoming an integral part of the overall shoe design.
THE ESSENTIALS OF PERFORMANCE
The adidas EQT (Equipment) franchise launches in 1991. The intent is to design a shoe solely to meet the needs of athletes by offering only the essentials of performance, protection, and comfort, while stripping away everything that was not necessary. In the early ‘90s, the minimal style is truly disruptive.
A NEW LEADER, A NEW CHAPTER 
In 1993 Robert Louis-Dreyfus becomes CEO. He takes over during a challenging point in adidas history. Together with Christian Tourres, he understands that the almost bankrupt adidas did not need to be reinvented, it simply needed a new direction. He turns the sleeping giant from a sales-driven to a marketing-driven company, steering adidas back on the path of growth. In 1995, six years after becoming a stock corporation, adidas goes public and its new marketing slogan could not sum it up better: “We knew then, we know now”.
Since 1987, only a handful of people have been trusted to lead adidas. René C Jäggi (1987 – 1992), Gilberte Beaux (interim 1992 – 1993), Robert Louis-Dreyfus (1993 – 2001), Herbert Hainer (2001 – 2016), Kasper Rorsted (2016 – 2022), and our current CEO Bjørn Gulden (2023 – present), have each played an important part in shaping the company. 
From Vice President of Marketing to CEO. In 1987 René C Jäggi becomes the company's first CEO after Horst Dassler.
Gilberte Beaux is the first female CEO, albeit interim, after adidas' transition to a stock corporation. She leads the company during the period before Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
Robert Louis-Dreyfus was CEO from 1993 to 2001, orchestrating a successful turnaround with a clear focus on marketing and international expansion.
Herbert Hainer is the company's longest-serving CEO, taking the reigns from 2001 to 2016. He leads the company into new area of growth based on great innovations including Climacool (2002), adizero (2004), Boost (2013).
Kasper Rorsted begins to steer adidas towards a digital era, after leading the German consumer goods company Henkel for eight years.
In 2023 Bjørn Gulden becomes CEO. A true sports Romantic, Bjørn has almost 30 years of experience in the Sports industry. Bjørn started his career at adidas in the 1990s and returns to the 3 Stripes to take the company into a new era.
A FOOTBALL LEGEND IS BORN
Since 1994, the Predator football boot has been worn by the world’s top players; it’s distinctive look and iconic tongue—featured in some versions—has graced the pitch for many  of football’s most momentous matches. The secret to the shoe’s success? That lies in the rippled rubber fins that provide increased power, swerve, and ball control.
SALOMON JOINS AS NEW TEAM MEMBER
adidas adds a new member to its team. With the acquisition of the Salomon Group and its brands Salomon, TaylorMade, Mavic, and Bonfire, the company changes its name to adidas-Salomon AG.
AN ICON FOR WOMEN’S FOOTBALL
Released in 1999, Icon is the first official match ball that adidas designs specifically for the FIFA Women’s World Cup™. The ball’s colorful design showcases the landmarks of the different host cities of the U.S. Each official match ball since 1999 is totally unique to the tournament it was designed for. The 2023 official match ball of the FIFA Women’s World Cup™, held in Australia and New Zealand, is inspired by the vast mountains of New Zealand and Australia’s connection with the Indian Ocean.  
NEW CENTURY, NEW DIVISIONS
As the new century starts, adidas reinvents the game again. In addition to its sport performance offering, adidas is the first in the industry to introduce a new lifestyle segment, focusing on sports-inspired streetwear. In the years to come, new partnerships with Yohji Yamamoto (2001) Stella McCartney (2002), and Pharrell Williams (2014) are born along with exciting labels, such as Y-3 (2003).
IMPOSSIBLE? JUST A BIG WORD
In one of its most memorable marketing campaigns, adidas shows its biggest athletes, including David Beckham and Haile Gebrselassie, facing their fears, defeats, and challenges head-on only to prove that, indeed, ‘Impossible is Nothing.’ The slogan becomes synonymous with reaching your goals.
SALOMON LEAVES THE TEAM, REEBOK JOINS THE FAMILY
One year after adidas and Salomon go their separate ways — when the latter and its brands (excluding TaylorMade) are sold — adidas acquires Reebok, including the brands Rockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey. This brings together two of the world’s most respected and best-known companies in the sporting goods industry.
WHAT BELONGS TOGETHER COMES TOGETHER
From the court to the catwalk, from the stadium to the streets. The adidas brand offers apparel and footwear for every sport, every sense of fashion, and every style, whether you are an athlete or fashionista. In 2011, adidas brings together sport, life on the streets, and style for the first time in one campaign to tell the world what it means to go all in, heart over head, and choose inclusion over your ego. The ‘adidas is All In’ campaign features the likes of Lionel Messi, David Beckham, and Derrick Rose; the campaign grew from the idea that whatever your goals or challenges may be, you have to go all in for the ultimate success.
ADIDAS ACQUIRES FIVE TEN
When you are already great, how do you become even better? You keep on training or you join forces with someone who complements you and your strengths. In 2011, adidas acquires Five Ten, a leading brand in the technical outdoor market and within the outdoor action sport community.
ENDLESS INNOVATION
Running has changed forever. Those are big words and history will tell us if it is true. adidas introduces the Energy Boost running shoe, which features a completely new cushioning material. Created in cooperation with the German chemical company BASF, the material combines a soft and responsive cushioning, which runners previously thought of as a contradiction of benefits; the result turns out to be a running experience unlike any other.
RUNTASTIC NEWS
Driven by their commitment to inspire and enable athletes of all levels to harness the power of sport in their lives, adidas acquires the fitness app Runtastic in 2015. The addition of Runtastic to the adidas portfolio, is an investment into the convergence of sport, digital and data in an always connected world. 
TAKING INNOVATION TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION
adidas unveils Futurecraft 4D, the world’s first high performance piece of footwear, featuring midsoles crafted with light and oxygen using Digital Light Synthesis—a technology pioneered by Carbon. The process of Digital Light Synthesis enables adidas to bring the most personalized performance products into reality by precisely addressing the needs of each athlete, with respect to movement, cushioning, stability, and comfort.
HOME SWEET HOME
adidas celebrates the opening of its new office building called Arena, finalizing the expansion of the company’s headquarters from the “World of Sports” in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Now, for the first time ever, all Herzo-based employees are located on one campus in an environment that fully embraces the company’s unique company culture. 
SEEING POSSIBILITIES (AGAIN)
Rember that famous campaign which launched in 2004, something about impossible and nothing…? Well, in 2021, adidas chooses to see possibilities again, relaunching the iconic brand campaign ‘Impossible is Nothing.’ Told in the documentary style of home footage, the campaign provides a previously unseen side to some of the most documented individuals in the world. The campaign is carried out via a powerful narrative as told by friends or fellow athletes and animated via resurfaced footage from the archives.
REEBOK DIVESTITURE
After careful consideration and an understanding that both Reebok and adidas would better realize their growth potential independently of one another, the decision is made to begin the formal process aimed at divesting Reebok.
DRIVEN BY ATHLETE DATA
First incorporated in the Futurecraft Strung shoe in 2021, the innovation Strung, is unique to adidas and is the first textile technology that transforms athlete data into dynamic performance material. By using precise thread placement based on athlete date, the technology aims to maximize performance by seamlessly combining support flexibility and breathability. Since 2021, the Strung technology has been applied to running and football products.
ADIDAS X GUCCI
Building on the legacy of previous premium athleisure collaborations, in 2022 a new partnership makes waves for the adidas brand. Gucci and adidas Originals confirm that they are joining forces in a new collaboration – adidas x Gucci – that combines the heritage and the creative codes of both brands. The first collection debuts on the runway, featuring a kaleidoscope of color and merging the iconic trefoil and Gucci emblems.
RACING AT ITS LIGHTEST
adidas unveils the Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 and its lightest ever running shoe. Weighing in at 138 grams, the shoe is 40% lighter than any other shoe adidas has ever created and is industry defining. The shoe helps multiple athletes set new personal bests and break records.
On September 24, 2023, Tigist Assefa smashes the world record for a women’s marathon in a time of 2:11:53 at the BMW Berlin Marathon. Her shoe of choice is the groundbreaking Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1. The achievement will remain a proud moment in the adidas history.
SAMBA. SHOE OF THE YEAR
On November 29, 2023, the adidas Samba is named Shoe of the Year by Footwear News. The shoe, which was first released in 1950 as a football boot, has come a long way. In 2023, the Samba find a new lease of life as the hottest streetwear shoe on the market.
"IT IS SO COOL TO SEE THAT A SHOE THAT I USED TO PLAY INDOOR SOCCER WITH IN THE ’80S IS NOW THE SHOE OF THE YEAR IN 2023. THE SAMBA IS AN ICON THAT WE AT ADIDAS ARE VERY PROUD OF."
-Bjørn Gulden, CEO of adidas
UNDER PRESSURE? YOU GOT THIS
Dedicated to the next generation of athletes, the ‘You Got This’ campaign launches. Bringing together world-class athletes to create a positive rallying cry to help everyday athletes believe they can overcome pressure and achieve their possibilities in sport.
"PRESSURE HAS MESSED WITH YOUR GAME LONG ENOUGH. IT’S TIME TO REMEMBER IT’S ONLY PRESSURE. IT’S ONLY A KICK, A THROW, A GOAL. YOU GOT THIS."
BIG BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS
In 2024, adidas marks an important milestone: its 75-year anniversary. With a storied history, countless innovations, a proven track record of creating only the best for the athlete, the brand continues to embrace Adi Dassler’s legacy. Its enduring success is rooted in the adidas employees, the people behind the scenes whose continued dedication and passion allows the brand to keep pursuing its purpose: 'Through sport, we have the power to change lives.'
In the same year, adidas celebrates 100 years since Adi Dassler and his brother registered the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’, the foundation for what will become two of the biggest sports companies in the world today.

HUMAN RIGHTS
adidas recognizes its corporate responsibility to respect human rights.
We recognize that we have a responsibility to respect human rights and understand the importance of showing that we are taking the necessary steps to fulfil this social obligation. We strive to operate responsibly along the entire value chain by safeguarding the rights of our own employees and those of the workers who manufacture our products, and by applying our influence to affect change wherever we cause or contribute to human rights impacts, or where human rights issues are linked to our business activities.
For over 25 years, our human and labor rights program has been focused on delivering on this commitment through the application of an ongoing Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD) strategy and process to identify, address, evaluate, and communicate the risks of involvement with adverse human rights and environmental impacts through our own operations, products, or services, or via our business relationships. We continue to adapt our approach, as both our understanding of risks as well as the expectations of stakeholders and regulators keeps evolving. As part of our broader risk management processes, we will increase the scope and application of HREDD efforts. By 2025, we aim to have a system in place to identify and manage high-risk human rights issues across our entire value chain.
Based on our decades-long experience in conducting human rights due diligence within our supply chain, adidas complies with the requirement to identify, address, and report on human rights-related and environmental risks, as defined in the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltpflichtengesetz - LkSG).
Please click here to read our report according to LkSG for 2023 (in German language only).
Our commitment to protecting human rights
Our Human Rights Policy, launched in 2022, supports our commitment to human rights. Endorsed by adidas’ Executive Board, the policy articulates our expectations of our own employees and our business partners to embed respect for human rights across our business operations. We have engaged in extensive consultation in the development of this policy, involving a wide range of internal stakeholders, including key business functions and employee representatives, as well as external stakeholders, civil society, and business and human rights experts. Stakeholder feedback has informed the content of the policy, the measures taken to support its implementation, and has further enhanced our understanding of the most salient issues to address as a company.
Additional policies supporting our commitment to protecting human rights

Accountability for human rights
While responsibility for respecting human rights and fulfilling our policy commitments lies with every adidas employee, the adidas Executive Board is ultimately responsible and accountable for the overall strategic direction of the business, and decides on adidas’ approach to, and processes for respecting human rights. The adidas Executive Board assigns the operational responsibility for the implementation of our Human Rights Policy to adidas’ General Counsel, who fulfils the role of Human Rights Officer (HRO). The HRO is responsible for monitoring human rights and environmental risk management processes and reporting regularly on these to the Executive Board. Nominated ‘risk owners’ in relevant internal functions are accountable for managing human rights and environmental risks in their respective area of operational responsibility, encompassing our own operations and supply chain. This includes carrying out annual risk analyses, the implementation of risk prevention and mitigation measures, and reporting on the outcome of these measures to the HRO. 
Awareness of human rights in our business
We recognize the need to raise awareness among our employees on their responsibility to respect human rights and how to identify potential or actual human rights issues. All new employees are given induction training to familiarize them with adidas policies and procedures, including the Human Rights Policy. Within adidas, familiarity with the requirements of the company’s Fair Play (ethical business) code of conduct is mandatory. All employees must participate in and pass online training on the code.

HUMAN RIGHTS & ENVIRONMENTAL DUE DILIGENCE (HREDD)
Identifying and prioritizing human rights and environmental risks
Since its inception in 1997, our human and labor rights program has been built on the back of intense stakeholder outreach and engagement, seeking to understand and define the most salient issues to address as a company. Through those engagements we have identified the following as salient issues for our human rights program and the focus for our human rights and environmental due diligence efforts: labor rights, wages, discrimination and harassment, freedom of association and collective bargaining, occupational health and safety, child labor, forced labor and human trafficking, the environment, including climate change, water, the use of hazardous chemicals, and waste, privacy, corruption, and sports sponsorship.
Given the scale and complexity of our value chain – with goods sourced from more than 40 countries globally and sold in over 100 markets – it is not practical to conduct human rights impact assessments continuously across all entities linked to our products or operations. We have therefore developed a due diligence approach that targets high-risk locations, processes or activities that require the closest attention and where we are able to apply influence to mitigate or remediate issues, where they occur. We also recognize that although everyone's human rights and fundmental freedoms must be respected and upheld, particular attention must be given to vulnerable groups, minorities or indigenous groups, or those whose circumstances open them up to exploitation or the abuse of their rights.
We also seek to extend our reach by cascading responsibilities to our partners, to capture and address potential and actual human rights issues - both upstream and downstream of our product creation.
Preventing and mitigating adverse impacts
The strategies applied to preventing and mitigating issues will be dependent on the relationship between adidas and the source of the risk, the severity of the issue, and our ability to influence the party directly responsible. Although we recognize the need to address all salient human rights issues we have identified, as our influence and ability to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts is greatest with our business partners, we have focused our efforts on fair labor practices, fair compensation and safe working conditions in factories manufacturing on behalf of adidas.
In our own operations, as a company managing around 60,000 employees, we have established standards and rules that specify the company’s responsibilities towards respecting the human rights of our global workforce. Through the policies and procedures of our Human Resources department, along with other relevant functions, internal systems are in place to protect employee rights and entitlements, and compliance with the core policies are regularly monitored by the Corporate Internal Audit function. More information on our approach to own operations, including initiatives focusing on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, can be found here.
Access to Remedy
We are committed to providing for, or cooperating in, the remediation of adverse human rights impacts which we have caused or contributed to, and we will seek to promote or cooperate in the mitigation and remediation of adverse impacts where we are linked to these through our business relationships. To complement our due diligence processes, we have put in place a range of grievance channels to ensure we provide adequate access to remedy for affected parties.
Our third-party complaints mechanism, established in 2014, offers a channel for the reporting of any potential, or actual, human rights or environmental harm linked to adidas’s operations, products or services, and is open to any individual or organization directly affected by an issue, or any organization which represents individuals or communities directly affected.

Disclosure of complaints received and actions taken 
As part of the third-party complaint mechanism, at the end of each year we have committed to communicate, via our corporate website, how many third-party complaints it has received related to labor or human rights violations and the status of those complaints (i.e., being investigated, successfully resolved, etc.). The majority of these complaints have been received from trade unions and labor and human rights advocacy groups. They are distinct from complaints received directly from workers through worker hotlines and other grievance channels operated in the countries where we source product.

Cases received and actions taken: 2024 - 2023 -  2022 - 2021 - 2020 - 2019 - 2018 - 2017 - 2016 - 2015 - 2014

Suppliers to adidas are required to have grievance systems in place where workers can freely and – should they decide to – anonymously submit any complaints or suggestions they may have. Workers in the supply chain may also raise concerns or complaints directly with adidas via local hotlines, which are run by non-profit organizations or our own field staff. In addition, we deploy a digital, app-based operational grievance mechanism at all our strategic supplier sites. Over 600,000 workers employed in more than 120 manufacturing facilities across 17 countries have access to this digital system, reflecting a 100% coverage of strategic manufacturing partners.
In our own operations, the global Fair Play Hotline enables our employees to submit complaints anonymously. Cases of complaints or of non-compliance are tracked with the support of a network of compliance officers worldwide.
We recognize the value of information received through all these grievance channels in informing our due diligence processes and the development of effective remedies. Wherever relevant, we utilize such information, and the experience gained through managing complaints processes, to support the implementation of improvements in our own practices, prevention, or remedial efforts.


Disclosure of our human rights progress and performance
We are committed to transparency and disclosure of our human rights progress and performance through external stakeholder engagement, regular communication, and reporting:
We are transparent about our stakeholder engagement: Engaging openly with stakeholders is a fundamental part of our approach to human rights and sustainability more broadly. More information on this engagement can be found here.
We regularly disclose material, third-party audited information: Our reporting on our human rights work is integrated into the adidas Annual Report. For more information, including an archive of our Sustainability reports, see here.
We receive external recognition: Our transparency and disclosure have been awarded with leadership positions in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and the Know the Chain ranking, recognizing our efforts in managing human rights across our operations, as well as eradicating forced labor and human trafficking from our supply chains.
We are thought leaders: We also developed a summary of our key approaches and positions on human rights topics in our Human Rights Frequently Asked Questions to explain the adidas’ approach to integrating human rights into its business practices. This FAQ summary has been reproduced in several languages as an industry best practice by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), a non-profit organization which draws attention to the human rights impacts of business.

MODERN SLAVERY
Since the initiation of our robust social compliance and labor rights program founded at the end of the 1990s, we have been systematically addressing the risks associated with forced labor, child labor and migrant labor. To complement our labor and human rights monitoring program, which has been in place for over 20 years, we launched the modern slavery outreach program in 2016 to intensify our efforts on potential risks in the upstream supply chain, looking beyond our Tier 1 suppliers, to drive greater transparency in the extended supply chain. We report annually on the actions we have taken to assess and address potential risks associated with modern slavery and forced labor in our supply chain through our Modern Slavery Progress Reports.

SUSTAINABILITY
COMMUNITIES
Our community engagement is fully aligned with our overall purpose.
As a global sports company we believe that through sport, we have the power to change lives. Through our community engagement efforts, we put this purpose into action. Powered by our brand attitude ‘Impossible Is Nothing’ we aim to create social impact for our communities.  
Through charitable contributions, volunteering and knowledge sharing, we work hand-in-hand with local organizations in key cities, key sourcing locations and key markets to bring our purpose to life. Anchored in two pillars, ‘People’ and ‘Planet’, we aim to achieve the overarching goal of shaping a better future for everyone using sport as a positive vehicle of change.  
People: We drive access to sport for everyone and create an equal and safe environment for all when doing sport.   
Planet: We take action to end plastic waste by protecting the spaces we live and play in. We support sustainable and environmental initiatives that drive change and create real impact.  
Relief presents an additional social and humanitarian component to our efforts. As natural disasters and other crises can strike at any moment, adidas stands with its communities in the markets, cities and sourcing locations in challenging times.  
Our charitable giving guidelines support us in implementing our strategic priorities and adhering to our principles for social initiatives. To ensure that our community engagement efforts land with sustained impact, we thoroughly measure, track, and evaluate our social impact.
OUR ENGAGEMENT 
We strategically select projects and long-term partnerships that create social value and the impact needed to drive positive change most effectively – ranging from skill-based employee volunteering, financial/ in-kind donations to expert advice, grants and sponsoring.   
We give back: To maximize our positive impact, we create volunteer programs and company-matched fundraisers that encourage employees to actively engage and bring our core belief to life. Teams in all markets take part in multi-faceted volunteering initiatives, with projects ranging from sports coaching in safe places for women and girls to providing skills-based support to refugees to help them unlock their potential in the labor market. By continuously running fundraising campaigns that match employee donations, adidas continues to demonstrate our collective and united support as one adidas family.
We reduce product waste: As a sporting goods company, we have a responsibility for our planet. We do not want our products going to landfill, but rather give them a second life. While reducing waste, we also have the opportunity to create positive change by supporting communities in need with our products. Our product donations are supported by long-term partner organizations such as the Global Aid Network (GAiN) and Ora Kinderhilfe to ensure products are fairly distributed to create real change. 
We stand up for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: We want to make sport accessible, equitable, and safe for all. By championing individual uniqueness and cultivating a culture of belonging, we work together with expert organizations and local communities to create lasting change. Through programs such as TeamPride to support the LGBTQIA2+ community, United Against Racism to stand with people of color, or Breaking Barriers to engage more girls in sport, we create an environment in which everyone feels valued, recognized, rewarded, and is given the opportunity to perform at their best. 
We cooperate for change: Grassroots football is not only where the stars of tomorrow are made - Grassroots clubs are support systems for their local communities and they are under threat. adidas Football Collective and UEFA Champions League are championing grassroots football, so tomorrow’s stars can thrive.   
We build infrastructure for change:  By building infrastructure such as playgrounds and sports courts, we provide access to sports for communities around the world. For example, we've partnered with athletes like David Alaba to build a football pitch in his hometown of Vienna, Austria,  to create a space where people of all backgrounds can come together to enjoy the game of football. And with our partner, the US Soccer Foundation, we built more than 100 mini-pitches across North America to improve access to football and use the sport to transform and improve the lives of children in underserved communities.
We protect our planet: Our holistic approach to sustainability responds to the challenges that endanger our planet and people. Our activities range from awareness raising campaigns to collaborations with partners such as Parley for the Oceans to inspire action to fight plastic waste. Over the past few years, we have proved our commitment to saving the oceans in our annual Run for the Oceans events. In 2022, it became the biggest virtual running event in the history of adidas. For every 10 active minutes logged, we supported our partner Parley’s Global Cleanup Network to remove plastic waste (up to 250.000kg) from beaches and islands.

CIRCULARITY
adidas has been a pioneer in creating products with a circular end-of-life solution and adopts a systemic approach to addressing circularity challenges within its value chain.
At adidas, we define circularity as maintaining the value of products and materials at their highest level for as long as possible. This aligns with the UN Environmental Programme's definition as laid out in their report ‘Sustainability and Circularity in the Textile Value Chain’. 
Establishing and expanding circularity globally within our industry is a complex challenge that requires strong collaboration among multiple stakeholders. This includes direct and indirect value chain partners, ranging from collectors and sorters to pre-processing partners and recyclers, as well as suppliers and innovators.
adidas has been a pioneer in creating products with a circular end-of-life solution, known as ‘made to be remade’ (MTBR). This journey began with the introduction of the Futurecraft.Loop shoe in 2019, a 100% mono-material performance running shoe that was made according to circular design principles. We successfully scaled this concept from a prototype back in 2019 to a fully commercial MTBR apparel and footwear collection across multiple categories through 2023. During the last few years, we learned that the implementation of circular services requires tight collaboration with partners along the entire value chain including collection, sorting, and recycling of waste. The MTBR program will therefore expire in 2024, with insights and experiences being used to inform the development of an industry-wide closed-loop scaling.
Circularity also includes services that help consumers to value their products longer. adidas carried out in previous years several pilots on such circular services, like sneaker cleaning in stores, rental and take-back programs. In 2023, we focused on the topic of repair to extend the lifespan of our products. We maintained a repair service at our Munich Terrex store and launched a rental program pilot in our new concept store in Berlin.
adidas has a long history with our circularity journey, with several key milestones already accomplished. Review our circularity journey here:
In 2023, we refined our approach to circularity by adopting a systemic approach to addressing circularity challenges within our value chain. Utilising frameworks established by industry organisations and upcoming regulatory requirements, we identified pertinent actions to be implemented across our entire value chain operations.  We have evolved our approach to circularity to support the creation of an ecosystem necessary to bring closed loops to scale in our industry, thereby sharing our knowledge and examining lessons learned from past circular services piloted and the MTBR product design criteria.
In addition, we are expanding our engagement in EU-funded cross-industry circular research projects like Textile Recycling Excellence (‘T-REX’) and the ‘New Cotton Project’, as well as partnering with Fashion For Good for the Sorting For Circularity project series, that all aim to unlock business benefits of circular textile economy end-to-end.
Textile Recycling Excellence’ (‘T-REX’): This project brings together 13 major actors from across the entire value chain, with adidas as coordinator and leader, to create a harmonised blueprint and business opportunities for closed-loop sorting and recycling of household textile waste in the EU. The key objective is transforming end-of-use textiles from waste into a desired feedstock and a commodity for new business models, thus proving the economic viability of a scalable circular economy for textiles in Europe.
‘New Cotton Project’: adidas has been a partner in this EU-funded project, which is an industry and multistakeholder effort to scale the chemical recycling technology of Infinited Fibre Company with the ambition to expand circularity of cotton textile waste. The project will be completed in 2024 and has been impactful in scaling closed-loop textile sorting and recycling.
Projects with ‘Fashion for Good’: In addition to EU-funded projects, we are continuously involved in several projects with Fashion for Good. adidas is the lead sponsor of the ‘Sorting For Circularity’ project in the USA, an initiative by Fashion for Good and the Circle Economy. Through this series of projects, adidas has continuously collaborated with Fashion for Good and Circle Economy to develop a Sorting for Circularity framework, a comprehensive guide for mapping the garment lifecycle, capturing textile waste, and unlocking its recycling potential. This framework is a valuable tool for the fashion industry to transition towards circularity.
‘FastFeetGrinded’: adidas also partnered with FastFeetGrinded to test shoe recycling processes, aiming to develop a scalable solution for the footwear industry. The pilot involves deconstructing shoes into macro-components for repurposing and reuse.

ADIDAS RETURNS MORE THAN € 3,100 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN 2022
In December 2021, adidas had introduced its latest multi-year share buyback program. The first tranche of this program launched on January 10, 2022 and was completed on February 22, 2022. During that period, the company bought back 4,156,558 shares for a total amount of € 1,000 million. In addition to the company’s regular buyback activities and against the background of the formal closing of the Reebok divestiture on February 28, 2022, adidas launched a second share buyback program to return the cash proceeds from the Reebok divestiture to its shareholders. As a result, between March 14 and October 10, 2022, adidas bought back 8,978,138 shares for a total consideration of € 1,500 million. Taking into account both share buybacks, adidas bought back 13,134,696 shares for a total amount of € 2,500 million in 2022. Including the dividend payment of € 610 million in May 2022, the company returned more than € 3,100 million to its shareholders in 2022. After the completion of both share buybacks in 2022, adidas decided to cancel a total of 12,100,000 treasury shares, reducing the company’s share count and stock capital accordingly.

SUSTAINABILITY
CLIMATE CHANGE AND DECARBONIZATION
Climate change is impacting our world. As a leading global sports brand, we acknowledge our role and are committed to reducing our environmental impact. We are adapting our business, reducing our own operations footprint and driving innovation - all with the ambition to mitigate our impact on the climate.
Our Science-Based Targets
To ensure transparency and accountability, adidas has set ambitious climate targets validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) (last validation obtained in 2024). The SBTi supports companies in setting reduction targets that are scientifically grounded, helping businesses contribute effectively to global climate action.
OUR NEAR-TERM OWN OPERATIONS SBTI-VALIDATED TARGET: AIM FOR A 70% REDUCTION IN SCOPE 11 AND 22 ABSOLUTE3 GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS4 BY 2030, MEASURED AGAINST A BASELINE OF 2022
At adidas, we are aiming to reduce our GHG emissions across our own operations, including our administrative offices, distribution centers and retail stores. This tackles the areas that are in our direct control, tracked under Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. adidas does not consider the use of offsets5 to achieve this target. Reducing emissions from our own operations by 70% in 2030 equals a reduction of 2% of our total corporate emissions including supply chain, in the same timeframe.
1 Scope 1 GHG emissions: Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from operations owned or controlled by an organization (SBTi, 2025).
2 Scope 2 GHG emissions: Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating or cooling consumed by an organization (SBTi, 2025).
3 Absolute emissions: Absolute emissions refer to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released by an organization, measured in mass or tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)6 (aligned with SBTi, 2025).
4 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, a process called the greenhouse effect. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, increase the release of these gases, contributing to global warming and climate change (IPCC, 2018).
5 Offset/Carbon offsetting: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a carbon offset is a reduction of GHG in order to balance out an emission made elsewhere. Essentially, offsetting refers to buying carbon credits which are tradable units of reduced GHG emissions from projects outside an organization‘s operations (IPCC). However, it’s important to note that buying these credits doesn't actually reduce the emissions created by the original activity—it's just compensating for them by funding projects that cut emissions elsewhere. In other words, carbon offsetting doesn’t directly lower the emissions from the activity you’re trying to offset.
6 Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is the universal unit to compare the impact of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) on global warming. It reflects how much each GHG contributes to atmospheric harm in relation to carbon dioxide. Converting emissions from gases other than CO2 into CO2e units allows for easier comparison of their effects as well as understand the overall effect of GHG emissions on the climate (aligned with IPCC, 2025).
As we are aiming for this target, we are focusing on the following key initiatives:
Powering up on Renewables: (67% reduction)
We are increasing our renewable electricity consumption through solar photovoltaic projects, power purchase agreements7, and virtual power purchase agreements (PPAs & VPPAs) across key locations, including Germany, China, Europe, and North America.
On-Site Solar Projects: In 2024, we implemented additional on-site solar projects at the DC Manchester and at our factory outlet in Herzogenaurach.
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): We continue to increase the renewable energy coverage by procuring renewable electricity through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs). After securing a VPPA contract for many European countries in 2023, we also signed a VPPA contract for the USA and Canada in 2024. The European project will become operational in 2025, the project for North America in 2026.
7 Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are long-term energy supply agreements concluded directly between a power consumer and a power producer, frequently renewable energy generators. By providing renewable electricity at mutually agreed rates, these contracts foster stability for both parties and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources. There are two main PPA variants:
PPAs (Power Purchase Agreement): The electricity produced is delivered to the buyers physically.
VPPAs (Virtual Power Purchase Agreement): An intermediary utility company handles the transfer of money and energy to and from the power producer on behalf of the buyer (RE100, 2022).
Improving Energy Efficiency: (3% reduction)
We are increasing energy efficiency through direct investments in building equipment, primarily at our corporate sites. This includes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning improvements, insulation, chiller replacements and LED retrofits in various locations.
In addition to these key initiatives, we are working on enhancing the quality of our energy data to make more informed strategic decisions. In 2024, we increased our primary data coverage for our own retail sites by 2% compared to the previous year, reaching 43% globally. Data coverage for administrative offices and distribution centers is at 100%, while data for showrooms and smaller offices was mostly estimated.
Our progress:
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
2024 value: 135,814 tons CO2e
2022 (baseline) value: 164,149 tons CO2e8
Progress 2024 versus baseline: 17% reduction
8 Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is the universal unit to compare the impact of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) on global warming. It reflects how much each GHG contributes to atmospheric harm in relation to carbon dioxide. Converting emissions from gases other than CO2 into CO2e units allows for easier comparison of their effects as well as understand the overall effect of GHG emissions on the climate (aligned with IPCC, 2025).
OUR NEAR-TERM INDIRECT EMISSIONS SBTI-VALIDATED TARGET: AIM FOR 42% REDUCTION IN SCOPE 3 ABSOLUTE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY 2030, MEASURED AGAINST A BASELINE OF 2022
In addition to our direct operations, we are reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our Scope 3 emissions9. Recognizing that a significant portion of these emissions is linked to our suppliers, we understand that meaningful change depends on strong partnerships and meaningful collaboration with them. Through our Supplier Environmental Program, we provide the resources and guidance they need to reduce their environmental impact, which also impacts adidas’ carbon footprint. adidas does not consider the use of offsets to achieve this target.
9 Scope 3 GHG emissions: Scope 3 emissions are indirect GHG emissions (other than those covered in Scope 2) that occur from activities not directly controlled by the organization. adidas includes emissions from the categories purchased goods and services, fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, business travel, end-of-life treatment of sold products and downstream leased assets in its 2030 ambition (SBTi, 2025).
As we are aiming for this target, we are focusing on the following key initiatives:
Renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) (18% reduction):
We collaborate with our key suppliers to reduce energy consumption by driving energy efficiency and maximize generation and/or use of renewable energy. During 2024, suppliers participating in our Supplier Environmental Program sourced 24% of their electricity from renewable sources. This was achieved through on-site electricity generation, procurement via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), or high-quality Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)10. In particular, EACs were purchased where sourcing or scaling up of electricity from rooftop solar and/or RE PPA-Agreements was not possible/limited.
10 Energy attribute certificates (EACs): Energy attribute certificates (EACs) are contractual instruments that certify the production of renewable and/or low carbon energy (aligned with EPA, 2025).
Material innovation (10% reduction):
We are scaling the use of lower-carbon materials, such as recycled, renewable, and organic options. As part of our material innovation efforts, we have successfully transitioned 99% of our polyester to recycled polyester.
Phasing Out Coal (6% reduction)
We provide guidance to assist our Tier 1 (assembly of products) and Tier 2 (material processes and manufacturing of product parts) suppliers in phasing out coal by 2025, transitioning to lower-carbon alternatives such as biomass and natural gas. By the end of 2024, more than half of the targeted suppliers in the Supplier Environmental Program have successfully upgraded their equipment and transitioned to lower-carbon alternatives.
Driving Process Improvement and Innovation (5% reduction):
We actively support the development and scaling of lower-carbon solutions in material processing, manufacturing, as well as product assembly that help us reduce GHG emissions. This includes innovations such as process electrification and lower-temperature assembly.
Other decarbonization levers (3% reduction) include, amongst others, increasing the use of lower-carbon fuels for transportation, packaging optimization, using recycled and certified packaging materials.
In 2024, 85% of our primary cardboard packaging was recycled, and 83% of our polybags were made of recycled plastic.
Setting Science-Based Targets
We encourage and support our suppliers in setting Science-Based Targets, offering training programs in local languages to facilitate their adoption.
Our progress:
Scope 3 GHG emissions
2024 value: 5,248,523 tons CO2e
2022 (baseline) value: 6,578,270 tons CO2e
Progress 2024 versus baseline: 20% reduction
Our Path to 2030
At adidas, we have set ambitious targets and developed a comprehensive roadmap to achieve a meaningful emission reduction. We also recognize the need to address potential additional emissions resulting from business- and production growth to stay on track with our goals.
The below chart illustrates our current 2030 emission reductions action roadmap across various areas of our entire business, in line with our science-based near-term targets and summarizes the above explained measures.
OUR LONG-TERM EMISSIONS SBTI-VALIDATED TARGET: AIM FOR A 90% REDUCTION IN SCOPE 1, 2, AND 3 ABSOLUTE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY 2050, INCLUDING RELIANCE ON YET-TO-BE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES, MEASURED AGAINST A BASELINE OF 2022.
Our 2050 ambition relies on breakthrough innovations and technologies that are not yet fully developed or commercially available at scale. These are expected to account for around 45% of our total emission reduction needed by 2050. However, we cannot yet determine the exact innovations and technologies that will contribute to this 45% reduction or the extent of their impact.
We actively explore cutting-edge solutions with the potential to reduce our environmental impact, including, among others, renewable feedstocks like algae-derived materials, carbon capture and utilization,11 lower carbon coloration technologies and alternative energy sources such as hydrogen. Additionally, we are monitoring advancements in textile-to-textile recycling, regenerative agriculture, and innovative business models such as repair services. Our approach involves assessing and investing in scalable innovations, collaborating with industry partners, and adapting to technological and regulatory developments. By balancing immediate actions with long-term innovation, we are aiming to drive meaningful change.
11 Carbon capture and utilization (CCU): A process in which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and then used to produce a new material/product (aligned with SBTi, 2025).
As we are aiming for this target, we do not consider the use of offsets, instead we are focusing on the following key initiatives:
Scope 1 & 2 Initiatives (3% reduction)
Powering up on Renewable (2,9% reduction)
Improving Energy Efficiency: (0,1% reduction)
Scope 3 Initiatives (87% reduction)
Renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) (18% reduction)
Material innovation (10% reduction).
Phasing Out Coal (6% reduction).
Driving Process Improvement and Innovation (5% reduction).
Other decarbonization levers (3% reduction).
Innovations and technologies not yet fully developed (45% reduction).
Our net-zero ambition
According to the IPCC (2018), net-zero emissions are achieved when human-caused GHG emissions are balanced by removing the same quantity of emissions from the atmosphere over a specified period of time. Put simply, net zero emissions mean that the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is equal to the amount we remove.
Beyond our 90% target, we consider neutralizing the remaining (up to 10%) of our absolute emissions for which reduction actions aren’t viable. In line with SBTi, we will neutralize (offset) these remaining emissions through high-quality permanent carbon removal solutions. We will ensure that we invest only in certified high-quality projects that will ensure additionality, permanence, exclusivity and with environmental and social safeguards.
Our aim for 2050 requires collective action
Our climate action efforts extend beyond our direct business activities to include advocacy work and community engagement initiatives.
Shaping the regulatory environment
We will continue to actively engage with policymakers, industry associations and NGOs to support governments in shaping an effective regulatory framework for environmental sustainability. For example, our successful advocacy around a policy approach for Power Purchase Agreements in Vietnam will enable suppliers to gain easier access to renewable energy, supporting their decarbonization efforts.
Collaborating at industry level
We partner with industry leaders to drive systemic change and share best practices. As part of the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action steering committee, we help shape industry-wide climate action.
Increasing Consumer Awareness
Through Move for the Planet, we inspire consumers and educate sporting communities about the importance of environmental sustainability and climate change.
Our journey to net-zero (including up to 10% through offsetting) is an ambition for which we still don’t have all the answers.
We are dedicated to minimizing our emissions and continuously seeking innovative solutions, while remaining committed to transparency, collaboration and progress.
CDP Rating
Our efforts to implement our reduction measures and operate transparently have been recognized by CDP, awarding adidas an A Rating on their 2024 CDP Climate Rating List.

CLIMATE GLOSSARY:
The climate glossary offers definitions for key terms related to our Climate Action plan, drawing from widely recognized organizations and institutions, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which provides the framework for our science-based climate targets. While not exhaustive, the list aims to clarify the most important terms used in the context of our climate strategy.
Absolute emissions: Absolute emissions refer to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released by an organization, measured in mass or tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) (aligned with SBTi, 2025).
Carbon capture and utilization (CCU): A process in which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and then used to produce a new material/product (aligned with SBTi, 2025).
Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is the universal unit to compare the impact of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) on global warming. It reflects how much each GHG contributes to atmospheric harm in relation to carbon dioxide. Converting emissions from gases other than CO2 into CO2e units allows for easier comparison of their effects as well as understand the overall effect of GHG emissions on the climate (aligned with IPCC, 2025).
CDP: CDP is a global non-profit organization providing an environmental disclosure system for companies, capital markets, cities, states, and regions. Investors and purchasers, along with policymakers around the globe, use this self-reported data and insights to make better-informed decisions (CDP, 2025).
Energy attribute certificates (EACs): Energy attribute certificates (EACs) are contractual instruments that certify the production of renewable and/or low carbon energy (aligned with EPA, 2025).
Entire business: For the scope of carbon accounting, we use the term 'entire business' in relation to all activities as defined under our Scope 1, 2 and 3. This covers all activities related to our own operations and our products.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, a process called the greenhouse effect. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, increase the release of these gases, contributing to global warming and climate change (IPCC, 2018).
Lower-carbon fibers/materials/processes: Fibers, materials or processes that generate lower levels of CO2e when compared to the conventional method of production (aligned with Textile Exchange, 2023).
Net-zero: Net-zero emissions are achieved when the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the atmosphere by human activities equals the amount of GHGs removed from the atmosphere over a specified period of time (aligned with IPCC, 2018).
Offset/Carbon offsetting: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a carbon offset is a reduction of GHG in order to balance out an emission made elsewhere. Essentially, offsetting refers to buying carbon credits which are tradable units of reduced GHG emissions from projects outside an organization‘s operations (IPCC). However, it’s important to note that buying these credits doesn't actually reduce the emissions created by the original activity—it's just compensating for them by funding projects that cut emissions elsewhere. In other words, carbon offsetting doesn’t directly lower the emissions from the activity you’re trying to offset.
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are long-term energy supply agreements concluded directly between a power consumer and a power producer, frequently renewable energy generators. By providing renewable electricity at mutually agreed rates, these contracts foster stability for both parties and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources. There are two main PPA variants:
PPAs (Power Purchase Agreement): The electricity produced is delivered to the buyers physically.
VPPAs (Virtual Power Purchase Agreement): An intermediary utility company handles the transfer of money and energy to and from the power producer on behalf of the buyer (RE100, 2022).
Recycled materials: Recycled materials are reprocessed from recovered materials using a manufacturing process. Recycled materials are incorporated into materials, components or products (aligned with ISO 5157).
Regenerative agriculture: Regenerative agriculture refers to holistic farming systems that, among other benefits, improve water and air quality, enhance ecosystem biodiversity, produce nutrient-dense food, and store carbon to help mitigate the effects of climate change (FAO, 2025).
Renewable energy: Renewable energy refers to energy from sources that replenish (or renew) themselves naturally (RE100, 2022). At adidas, the following sources are considered renewable energy sources: solar, wind, sustainably sourced biomass (incl. biogas), geothermal, sustainably generated hydropower.
Renewable materials: Renewable materials are composed of biomass and can naturally be replenished (Textile Exchange).
Science-based targets (SBTs): Corporate targets to reduce GHG emissions that are in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (SBTi, 2025).
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a corporate climate action organization that enables companies and financial institutions worldwide to play their part in combating the climate crisis. It develops standards, tools, and guidance which allow companies to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets in line with what is needed to keep global heating below catastrophic levels and reach net-zero by 2050 at the latest (SBTi, 2025).
Scope 1 GHG emissions: Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from operations owned or controlled by an organization (SBTi, 2025).
Scope 2 GHG emissions: Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating or cooling consumed by an organization (SBTi, 2025).
Scope 3 GHG emissions: Scope 3 emissions are indirect GHG emissions (other than those covered in Scope 2) that occur from activities not directly controlled by the organization. adidas includes emissions from the categories purchased goods and services, fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, business travel, end-of-life treatment of sold products and downstream leased assets in its 2030 ambition (SBTi, 2025).
Tier 1 suppliers: Tier 1 suppliers to adidas are suppliers responsible for the assembly of products, such as sewing t-shirts or assembling shoes.
Tier 2 suppliers: Tier 2 suppliers to adidas are suppliers processing materials and manufacturing product parts, such as molding shoe soles.

SUPPLIER LISTS
adidas outsources most of its production. Being committed to transparency and public disclosure, we have fully disclosed our global factory lists and published detailed information including the names and locations of suppliers by country since 2007. This extends to primary suppliers, subcontractors, licensees and suppliers where the majority of wet processes are carried out.  
The data presented in our disclosure comes from an industry leading website, the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC). The accuracy of the lists is heavily dependent on the disclosure provided to us by our primary suppliers, who have direct relationships with these factories. While we have stable business relationships with many of our major manufacturing partners, we do see a degree of factory turnover throughout each year. As a result, our factory list always describes the current status of our active business relationships at the date mentioned. We strive to keep the disclosure of our primary suppliers, subcontractors and licensees as current as possible by updating the list twice a year. We also publish our supplier lists annually on the Open Supply Hub, an industry initiative that promotes open and transparent sharing of retail supply chain data.
If you have a query relating to a specific supplier factory and want to know whether it is currently making goods for adidas, please feel free to write to us and we will confirm its status. We can be reached at sustainability@adidas-group.com.

SUSTAINABILITY
SUPPLY CHAIN
As our supply chain is large, multi-tiered and varied, we have a detailed and systematic approach to managing the relationships with our suppliers.
Besides our own employees, workers in our suppliers’ factories play a central role in our sustainability program. It was our concern for their working conditions and well-being that led us to establish our Workplace Standards, the supply chain code of conduct, which also covers workers’ health and safety and provisions to ensure environmentally sound factory operations. To enforce compliance with our Standards we have a multi-level monitoring and enforcement process in place, which includes the use of a rating system for the assessment of our suppliers. The rating results are shared with our Sourcing teams and incorporated into the overall supplier rating that influences our decision whether and to which extent we continue the business relationship with a specific supplier. This transparency and integration with sourcing decisions is fundamental to the success of our efforts to drive improvements in workplace conditions.
In addition to our own monitoring activities, we value independent and unannounced assessments by independent third parties to demonstrate the credibility of – and provide verified information about – our program to stakeholders. As a member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA), adidas is subject to external assessment by independent monitors, participation in the FLA third-party complaint system and public reporting. In 2005, our own  monitoring program was accredited by the FLA for the first time and re-accreditation took place in 2008 and in 2017. This decision was based on independent factory monitoring and verification reports of supplier facilities and a thorough audit of monitoring protocols, training programs and auditing systems.
The company’s global supply chain extends through various tiers from strategic manufacturing partners to componentry and materials suppliers, to raw material sources, such as cotton, leather and natural rubber. Working closely with key strategic partners, the vast majority of our products are produced in the facilities of around 108 manufacturing partners worldwide. We value long-term relationships: 65% of our independent manufacturing partners have worked with us for at least ten years and 35% have a tenure of more than 20 years. The length of our supplier relationship is determined by specific performance criteria which is regularly measured and reviewed. Moreover, suppliers are incentivized to achieve and maintain a high level of performance against these criteria through the awarding of higher orders.
adidas has outsourced most of its production. Overall, we work with more than 400 independent factories from around the world that manufacture our products in around 45 countries. Our supply chain is global and multi-layered, with many different types of business partners, some of whom are directly contracted factories, while others are not.

WHERE WE PLAY AND PERFORM
"...IF YOU WANT A JOB DONE WELL, YOU MUST CREATE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR IT."
ADI DASSLER, FOUNDER OF ADIDAS
Employees – just like athletes – need an environment that motivates, inspires, and empowers them to perform at their best. A workplace that is built upon our culture and enables creativity and team work to thrive.

ADIDAS WORKPLACE CONCEPT
Our adidas Workplace Concept is an activity-based working concept which means that employees no longer have assigned desks and instead choose from a variety of rooms and spaces, dependent on their needs.
The Workplace Concept starts well before our work does, ensuring our commute to work is integrated into local transport options, so we arrive ready to tackle the day. Within our office environment, we can perform based on our needs, whether that’s at a desk, in a kitchen hub, a focus space, or anywhere in between.
Like all athletes, recovery is an inherent part of our day. Sport and wellbeing are reflected in our workplace on multiple levels – from sport facilities to reflection rooms dedicated to prayer and meditation.
Our adidas Workplace Concept enables us to perform at our best, leaving room for local and cultural adaptations that give each of our workplaces a unique touch and our employees the flexibly needed to succeed in an environment that works for them.
WORKPLACE BENEFITS
Doing sports together and collaborating in our workplace is an important part of our culture and our unique team spirit. You’ll find various sport and fitness options on our campuses which enable work-sport integration and encourage our employees to embrace a healthy lifestyle. But just as much, it’s our goal to also offer flexibility. Find out more about some of our benefits below.

SUSTAINABILITY
OUR TARGETS
Our ambition is to become a more sustainable company.
Our commitment to sustainability has been embedded into our business practices for over two decades and is rooted in our purpose that ‘through sport, we have the power to change lives.’ To underline this commitment, in 2021, we have further sharpened our focus on sustainability and defined a roadmap for 2025 that allows us to create – and drive – positive impact. As we continue to pioneer in sustainability, we will continue to move to a comprehensive, consumer-facing sustainable article offering at scale, expand our circular services and work towards achieving climate neutrality (GHG) across our entire value chain. We will continue to empower our employees to become sustainability ambassadors, just as we invite our consumers globally to engage and connect with us on the topic of sustainability. Lastly, we aim to uphold the highest standards also of social compliance across our supply chain.  
We believe that achieving our sustainability targets will set us up for future success, yet we know that we cannot achieve these alone. We will leverage our long-term relationships with suppliers to ensure they continue to move with us in alignment with our decarbonization efforts and work closely with our partners to scale innovative materials and recycling technologies.  
Being a sustainable business is about striking the balance between shareholder expectations and the needs and concerns of our employees, consumers, suppliers, the workers in our supply chain and the environment. We truly believe that acting as a responsible business – one which is fully committed to respecting human rights – will contribute to lasting economic success. 
OUR TARGETS FOR 2025 
We have a clear roadmap, with clear targets for 2025. These targets focus on the topics that are most material to our business and our stakeholders. Highlights include:  
By 2025, nine out of ten adidas articles will be sustainable: We keep pushing the boundaries of our sustainable offering, so that our consumers are able to choose from a uniquely comprehensive range. By 2025, nine out of ten adidas articles will be sustainable. We define articles as sustainable when they show environmental benefits versus conventional articles due to the materials used, meaning they are – to a significant degree – made with environmentally preferred materials. We further aim to reduce GHG emissions per product by 15% by 2025.  
We care about people and the planet: As part of our broader risk management processes, we will increase the scope and application of Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD) efforts. By 2025, we aim to have a system in place to identify and manage high risk human rights issues across the entirety of our value chain. 
The following tables below provides an overview of the targets we have set for 2025, supporting our drive for positive environmental and social impact.

What is RSS?
RSS is a file format based on XML for exchanging news and web content. In contrast to HTML pages, RSS files provide structured information for automated processing by RSS reader programs (RSS readers).
What are RSS Feeds?
RSS delivers its information as an XML file called RSS feed. Many internet publications, magazines and blogs offer a multitude of captions and topics for RSS feeds, which can be freely compiled by users depending on their field of interest.
What are the benefits of RSS feeds?
All news about a specific topic is displayed in a comprehensive format in the RSS reader. Each user can select websites of interest and subscribe to the corresponding feed. Instead of having to open each website periodically, information is centrally stored in the feed reader and available as soon as new information is published on the respective websites.
What are RSS readers?
Users of RSS content use programs called feed 'readers' or 'aggregators': users 'subscribe' to a feed by supplying to their reader a link to the feed; the reader can then check the user's subscribed feeds to see if any of those feeds have new content and, if so, retrieve that content and present it to the user. There is a large number of free and commercial RSS readers available for download online. You can find further information about using an RSS feed and a selection of RSS readers at

Inside the building, adidas has implemented an innovative, flexible workplace concept that combines the advantages of open, communicative areas with those of retreat areas for focused activities and meetings. adidas developed this concept as part of a multi-year trial in a purpose-built building. The concept is currently being implemented at all of the company's office locations. At the company-own MakerLab in Herzogenaurach, Portland, Oregon and at the Brooklyn Creator Farm in New York, employees can let their creativity flow and put their ideas directly into practice thanks to a variety of materials and technologies available or learn new skills in workshops.
ADIDAS STORES

REPORTING
We recognize our responsibility to be accountable to our stakeholders, which involves the regular and open reporting of our sustainability performance.
From 2000 until 2016, adidas has been annually publishing its progress on set targets in standalone Sustainability Reports, as well as in a separate Environmental Report.
As of 2017, we integrated material non-financial information into the adidas Annual Report. Non-financial information is covered by a separate limited, and partially also reasonable assurance engagement based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) issued by the IAASB. adidas also applies global reporting standards such as the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accountability Standards Board (SASB) to inform its external non-financial reporting. We also acknowledge the value of climate-related reporting and are aiming to stepwise include the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations that enable companies to improve reporting of climate-related financial information, especially climate-related risks and opportunities.  
For 2023 we also publish a comprehensive report about our human rights and environmental supply chain due diligence.

SUSTAINABILITY
CHEMICALS AND WATER
Managing the environmental impacts at our own sites and along the entire value chain is a key focus of our work. We continue to address water efficiency and quality, with an advanced chemical management program in place.
In our supply chain, addressing environmental impacts is a priority. We collaborate with suppliers to optimize their energy use, carbon emissions, water, wastewater, chemicals, and waste. Our environmental program includes strategic suppliers at Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels, with whom we closely partner and provide training for continuous improvement. 
Guided by our ambition to best support our suppliers, we have developed environmental good practice guidelines with water saving initiatives. Through the use of new technologies and other solutions, we aim to achieve a 40% reduction in water intensity at Tier 2 supplier facilities by 2025, using 2017 as a baseline.  
adidas has made significant strides in establishing and executing a cutting-edge chemical management program within its supply chain. This comprehensive approach encompasses the oversight of chemical inputs, monitoring sustainable chemical management throughout the supply chain, and maintaining industrial benchmarked wastewater quality in all facilities. Furthermore, to enhance transparency and accountability, we have proactively published supplier performance data on public platforms. By prioritizing sustainability and environmental responsibility, we are setting new industry standards while minimizing our ecological footprint.  
Ensuring robust input chemical management: At adidas, sustainability and responsible practices are at the core of our brand identity. As a signatory of ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation), we adhere to their guidelines, including the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and Wastewater Guidelines. By 2025, our goal is for 80% of our chemical formulations used in production to achieve the highest conformance level (‘Level 3’) with ZDHC standards. To achieve this, our suppliers regularly report their chemical inventory and consumption through a third-party online platform. We closely monitor our chemical profiles to ensure compliance, environmental protection, and workers safety. Through these efforts, we strive for sustainable and responsible chemical practices
Monitoring management of chemical outputs: The textile industry faces a vital challenge in pollution abatement, and at adidas we have taken proactive measures to address this issue. Through regular monitoring, we have achieved impressive results in our suppliers’ wastewater discharge performance. Building on this success, we have set an even more ambitious objective. By 2025, we aim to ensure that 90% of suppliers operating on-site effluent plants attain the ZDHC Wastewater 'Foundational Level'. To facilitate continuous improvement, we have implemented an effluent treatment plant evaluation initiative, empowering suppliers to strengthen their control over wastewater discharge and meet environmental standards.
Disclosure: All of our strategic suppliers are required to test their wastewater twice a year according to the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines. The results of these tests must be disclosed on the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) DETOX platform and the ZDHC Gateway platform. 
Supplier audits: Our commitment is reflected in the comprehensive guidelines we have developed. Our Health and Safety Guidelines set strict standards for the storage, use, and protection of chemicals, and identifies chemicals that are prohibited for use in manufacturing due to health and safety concerns. In addition, our Environmental Guidelines and the Environmental Good Practice Guideline and Toolkit further outline our requirements for chemical management and wastewater discharge. These guidelines form the basis for both internal and external factory inspections and assessments.  
Product safety: The adidas 'A-01' Restricted Substances List (RSL) is recognized across our industry and was created to reduce the use of hazardous substances in the textile and apparel supply chain. In 1998, we adopted this comprehensive RSL for product materials, prohibiting the use of chemicals considered to be harmful or toxic. We continue to develop and update this policy on an ongoing basis to ensure we do not use banned or restricted chemicals in our products.  
Collaboration: Managing chemicals across multi-tiered supply chains is a complex endeavor that necessitates collaboration among various stakeholders for effective and sustainable solutions. At adidas, we foster strong relationships within the sustainability community and engage openly with our stakeholders. We actively collaborate with organizations such as the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) group, the Apparel & Footwear International Restricted Substances Management Working Group (AFIRM), the International Chemical Secretariat (ChemSec) Business Group, Better Cotton and the Leather Working Group (LWG), recognizing the importance of collective efforts to drive responsible chemical management practices in the apparel and footwear industry.

OWN OPERATIONS
An Integrated Management System (IMS) helps us to secure all relevant ISO management certifications across our administrative offices, distribution centers, production sites, and own retail stores. These include environmental management (ISO 14001), health and safety management (ISO 45001), energy management (ISO 50001), and – introduced in 2021 and planned to obtain for 2022 – facility management (ISO 41001). We aim to further expand these certifications to more key sites through implementation of the standards and both internal and external audits, as these support us to achieve our energy, water, waste, and health and safety targets.  
We will continue to improve the water efficiency at our highest consuming sites, aiming for a 15% reduction in water consumption per square meter for own operations by 2025, measured against 2019.
