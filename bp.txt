Our sustainability frame
Our sustainability frame
Our purpose is to deliver energy to the world, today and tomorrow.
  Our sustainability frame underpins delivery of our strategy, and our refreshed sustainability aims are focused on those that are most relevant to the long-term success of our business.  
Our focused sustainability aims
Net zero operations
Our aim is to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner for Scope 1 and 2 emissions within bp’s operational controla, including by maintaining ‘near-zero’ methane intensity across our operated producing assets, enabled by supportive government policies.
Net zero sales
Our aim is to reduce to net zero the average lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2050 or sooner, enabled by supportive government policies and the decarbonization of energy demand.
People
Our aim is to support our employees and local communities through the energy transition.
Biodiversity
Our aim is to support biodiversity where we operateb
Water
Our aim is to reduce our net freshwater use in stressed catchments where we operate. 
Footnotes
Our approach
Foundations and embedding sustainability
  Our approach to sustainability is targeted, systematic and collaborative – built on strong, foundations that guide the way we work and support our net zero, people and planet aims. We are working to embed sustainability more widely and deeply in our culture, business decisions, processes and governance. 
Our approach to sustainability
Engaging with our stakeholders
Engaging constructively helps us deliver our strategy and sustainability aims. We engage with many different stakeholders, in various ways – from local meetings to global partnerships.  

Our main stakeholder groups are employees, customers, investors and shareholders, government and regulators, partners and suppliers, and society. 
Our employees play a critical role in maintaining safe, reliable and compliant operations. We are committed to engaging them in the opportunities and challenges we face, as well as on their own development. 
We engage with governments, regulators and legislators on the development of policies that promote a secure, affordable and lower carbon energy system – enabling us to develop our strategy and embed sustainability across bp. 
Our engagement with local communities ranges from one-to-one conversations with our dedicated community liaison officers to large public consultations. 
We work with NGOs at international, national and local levels. Many of them have complementary expertise on social and environmental issues and we sometimes rely on them to act as a bridge between bp and other stakeholders. 
Our investor relations team coordinates our one-to-one engagement with key investors and our investor events, which include roadshows and results presentations.

Investors section
The price of shares and the income derived from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested. Investors should be aware that past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.

The information contained in this document concerning taxation is based on bp's understanding of legislation and practice in effect at the time the information was produced. That information may no longer be accurate because of subsequent changes in legislation or changes in interpretation or practice or because the levels or bases of taxation have changed. An investment in bp shares may not be suitable for all investors. You should take independent financial advice before making any investment decision.

None of the services or investments referred to on this site are available or appropriate for sale or use in any jurisdiction where such activity is prohibited. Any persons resident outside the United Kingdom who access this site must first satisfy themselves that they are not subject to any local requirements which prohibit or restrict them from doing so.

We use certain terms on this web site, such as "resources" and "non-proved reserves", that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in our filings with the SEC.
