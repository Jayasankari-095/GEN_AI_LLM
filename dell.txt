Whom we share your information with
We may share personal information with:
Third parties we use to help deliver our products and services to you or otherwise run our business, e.g., payment service providers, warehouses, delivery companies, marketing agencies, website hosts, website analytics providers, etc.
External auditors or professional advisors, e.g., lawyers and other advisors, in which case confidentiality obligations will bind the recipient of the information.
Law enforcement agencies, courts, tribunals, and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
Such third parties to whom we may sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
We may disclose your personal data to a third party where you direct and/or authorise us to do so.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and treat it in accordance with the law. Unless otherwise expressly notified, we do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process it for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
Your data subject rights
You may have the following data subject rights if granted under applicable laws, which may also be subject restrictions and exemptions:
Right to Know: you may have the right to request information about the personal information we have collected about you and for what purpose.
Right to Access: you may have the right to access your personal information and obtain a copy.
Right to rectification: you may have the right to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide.
Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): you may have the right to request the deletion of the personal information that we hold on you.
Right to restriction of processing: you may have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.
Right to Portability: you may have the right to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to have that information transmitted to another organization in certain circumstances.
Right to object to processing: you may have right to object to processing of your personal information where we rely on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data.
Right to withdraw Consent: You may have the right to withdraw consent, where we process your personal information based on your consent. If you withdraw your consent, it will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
If you wish to exercise your rights, please visit our Privacy Center and submit a request via our Privacy Request Portal Dell-PMC. To help protect the security of your personal information, we may request specific information from you to verify your identity. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Dell is legally obligated to keep a record of that.
Your marketing choices
You have choices about how we reach you with marketing offers and other uses of your information. To update your preferences, you can:
Click “unsubscribe” in any email marketing communications we send you.
Go to your MyAccount or visit our Preference Management Center to select your marketing communication choices.
Go to our List Removal Page to be removed from receiving marketing-related communications.
Please be aware that your email preferences may take up to 10 business days to take effect. Further, even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, you will still receive transactional communications that are essential for administrative or customer service purposes, such as order confirmations for a product/service warranty registration, updates to our Terms and Conditions, etc.
Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies
For more information about the cookies we use and how to change your cookie preferences, please see cookie statement. 
International Transfers
We may transfer your personal information to other companies within the Dell group and to its business partners as permitted by law if required for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. This may involve the transfer of your personal information to countries outside your home country or region, which may have a different level of data protection from your home country. Such countries may include, without limitation, the United States and other countries in which Dell or its subsidiaries, affiliates or business partners maintain facilities. In order to provide adequate protection for the transfer of your personal information, we have in place contractual arrangements (as appropriate) with our subsidiaries, affiliates and business partners in respect of such transfers. We will take all reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal information we transfer. 
We use appropriate mechanisms for international data transfers. For example, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK or Switzerland, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country. 
How we secure your information
We use appropriate technical, organizational, and physical data security safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. We encourage you to keep any passwords you use confidential and to avoid “phishing” scams where someone may send you an email that appears to be from Dell asking for your personal information. Dell will not request your ID or password through email. 
How long do we retain your information
We retain personal information for as long as necessary for us to accomplish the purposes for which the personal information was collected and for any retention periods specified by applicable law. Such legally prescribed retention periods may vary by area. We may retain certain personal information for a longer period to comply with applicable law and respond to or otherwise participate in legal claims. The specific retention period for any piece of personal information will be appropriately calculated to meet the relevant obligations and take into account any specific business needs or uses.
Collection and use of Children’s information
If you are a child/minor as understood by laws of your country, please do not submit any Personal Information through our websites without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.
Links to third-party websites and services
We may sometimes provide links to other websites, which, if you click on them, may collect personal information about you and direct you to those websites. The information practices of those third-party websites linked to our website are covered by the third party’s privacy statements, and we encourage you to read those.
Contact us
The Dell entity that controls your personal information may differ depending on where you live and the specific Dell products and services you use.
You can email: privacy@dell.com to contact us and our Data Protection Officer if you have any questions about this privacy statement or the information we hold about you, to exercise a right under data protection law, or to make a complaint. 
Changes to This Privacy Statement
We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. If we make changes to this Privacy Statement or make any material changes to how we use your Personal Information, we will revise this Privacy Statement to reflect such changes and revise this Privacy Statement's effective date, included at the end of this section. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of how we are using and protecting your Personal Information.

Belgique – devoir d’acceptation des déchets d’équipements électriques et électroniques (DEEE/WEEE) – B2C
  Depuis juillet 2001, la loi belge régit le devoir d’acceptation des déchets d’équipements électriques et électroniques par le producteur ou l’importateur. Cette loi détermine la politique environnementale sur laquelle les fédérations patronales et le gouvernement fédéral se sont accordés. En 2004, cette loi a été modifiée pour correspondre à la directive européenne n°2002/96/EC.

L’objectif de cette loi est la prévention et la gestion des déchets. Les fédérations coordonnées se sont engagées à améliorer la recyclabilité des produits mis sur le marché, notamment par une diminution de l’utilisation des matériaux composites et par l’identification des matériaux usagés.

Cette législation régit en outre la collecte et le traitement des équipements électriques et électroniques. La collecte a lieu via les points de collecte de « biens usagés », les parcs à conteneurs et les revendeurs. Le traitement est effectué par des entreprises de recyclage certifiées. Lors de celui-ci, les équipements en fin de vie sont divisés en deux catégories : réutilisables et non-réutilisables. Après élimination de tous les composants nocifs, les équipements non-réutilisables sont désassemblés. Les composants restants sont traités écologiquement et fournis aux vendeurs de matières premières aux fins de réemploi.

Recupel

Le 1e juillet 2001, les producteurs et importateurs d'équipement électriques et électroniques, avec le soutien des autorités régionales, ont fondé Recupel ASBL afin de répondre aux obligations fixées par la Convention de Politique Environnementale. Recupel organise la collecte et le recyclage des déchets d’équipements électriques et électroniques (DEEE) pour l’ensemble de la Belgique.

Recupel collabore étroitement avec les commerçants, les autorités régionales et les centres de recyclage, mais également avec les entreprises de logistiques spécialisées et les entreprises de recyclage pour le traitement écologique des équipements en fin de vie. Le financement de ces activités est assuré par une cotisation de recyclage supportée par le consommateur lors de l’achat d’un nouvel équipement.

Dell se conforme à la législation et est membre de Recupel.

Que signifie cette loi pour le consommateur?
Les ménages peuvent se débarrasser de leurs équipements électriques et électroniques usagés de trois manières différentes :
Lors de l’achat d’un nouvel équipement, ils peuvent rendre l’ancien, gratuitement, au fournisseur du nouveau.
Les équipements électriques et électroniques usagés peuvent être déposés gratuitement dans les points de collectes.
Les équipements électriques et électroniques usagés peuvent être déposés gratuitement dans les parcs à conteneurs communaux. La commune est responsable de la collecte séparée des équipements usagés provenant des ménages.
En tant que client Dell, vous pouvez choisir d’apporter vos DEEE dans un parc à conteneurs ou un point de collecte ou de participer à notre programme Consumer Recycling, accessible à l’adresse suivante : https://www.dell.com/nl-be/dt/corporate/social-impact/advancing-sustainability/how-to-recycle.htm#/

Remarque: Les petites entreprises peuvent également déposer leurs équipements électriques ou électroniques usagés au parc à conteneur communal si ces équipements sont, de par leur nature ou leur quantité, similaires à ceux des ménages privés.

Vous trouverez de plus amples informations concernant la collecte des équipements électriques et électroniques et sur les sujets annexes à l’adresse suivante : www.recupel.be.

(India)

By participating in the Dell International Services India Pvt. Ltd (“Dell”) Small Business Association Program the association (herein referred to as the “Customer”) agrees to comply with and be bound by these Program Participation Terms and Conditions (“Participation Terms”) and any additional terms, including as set forth in related agreements entered into between the parties (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). These Participation Terms set out the terms upon which Dell and the Customer will offer the Customer’s members and/or staff (“Members”) a discount on selected Dell-branded consumer and commercial products purchased in India (“Products”) as part of the Small Business Association Program (“Program”).

1. Terms of Sale

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that each qualifying Product purchase by Members participating in the Program will be subject to Dell’s standard Terms of Sale available at Terms and Conditions of Sale | Dell India (“Terms of Sale”) which Dell may update from time to time without prior notice.

2. Term

The initial term of the Agreement will commence on the date these Participation Terms are accepted by the Customer and will continue for one (1) year thereafter (“Initial Term”) unless otherwise terminated earlier. At the conclusion of the Initial Term, and on an annual basis thereafter, the Agreement will renew for additional periods of one (1) year at Dell’s discretion (each such period a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). The Customer will be notified before the end of the Initial Term and/or each subsequent one (1) year term if Dell does not wish to retain the Agreement for a further Renewal Term.

3. Pricing and Discounts

Dell will at its sole discretion select the Dell-branded Products which will qualify for purchases by Members under the Program, and such qualifying products may be subject to change from time to time without notice. The discounts applicable under the Program shall depend on the Product, Product configuration and warranty purchased by a Member. Dell reserves the right to change published prices and discounts at any time for any reason. All Product purchases made directly with Dell with a discount under the Agreement are subject to applicable taxes. Sales and other taxes associated with the transaction will be shown on Dell’s invoice. Dell will only honor the prices stated on the Dell quote and reserves the right to decline orders that may carry a price other than what is stated on the Dell quote.

4. Coupons & Orders

(b) Members can redeem coupons online at https://www.dell.com/en-in or by contacting a Dell sales representative via telephone on 1800-571-4026. Members must submit a Product order using the relevant unique coupon code made available during the onboarding process. If a Member places a Product order via telephone, the Member must identify themselves as a Member of the Customer to get the discount referenced and qualify for a Product purchase under the Program.

(c) A Product order is only considered accepted by Dell after the Member has received a written order confirmation. Dell reserves the right to cancel a Product order that is placed under wrongful conditions. If a Product order is subsequently cancelled or returned, the coupon will no longer be valid, and the respective coupon code cannot be reapplied to another Product order.

(d) The coupon cannot be used against non-qualifying products or segments and is not available in conjunction with any other offers, discounts, promotions, coupons, privileges or programs, unless otherwise expressly stated.

(e) The coupon cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced or redeemed for cash. Dell reserves the right to change coupon promotions at any time.

6. Licenses

a) Dell agrees to grant the Customer a limited, revocable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, non-exclusive license to use its name, logo, and trade and service marks (“Dell Marks”) for the purpose of accurately identifying the Products and related services and describing the Program to the Members in accordance with the Agreement. The Customer must obtain prior written approval from Dell for all uses of the Dell Marks. The Customer agrees to preserve and respect the value and integrity of the Dell Marks, and comply with all Dell brand, trademark and logo guidelines. The Customer shall change or correct, at the Customer’s expense, any material or activity that Dell decides is inaccurate, objectionable, misleading, or a misuse of the Dell Marks. Except as provided herein, the Customer shall not register or use any domain name or business name containing or confusingly similar to any Dell name or mark. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no rights whatsoever in any of the Dell Marks other than the rights set forth in the Agreement. Nothing in the Agreement or otherwise will be deemed to grant to the Customer an ownership interest in the intellectual property rights in the Dell Marks, Products or services, in whole or in part.

b) The Customer hereby grants to Dell a non-exclusive license to use its name, logo, trade name, and service marks (“Customer Marks”) to promote the Program to Members, to the extent contemplated under the Agreement. Dell acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no rights whatsoever in any of the Customer Marks other than the rights set forth in the Agreement.

7. Confidentiality

(a) The Customer and its employees, agents and contractors must not, without Dell’s prior written consent: (i) disclose to any third party and/or (ii) use in any way other than as the Agreement contemplates, information acquired by or on behalf of Dell at any time, which concerns, relates to or arises from the products, services, business affairs, processes, activities or other operations of Dell, its affiliated companies or which Dell expressly identifies as Dell’s confidential information (“Dell’s Confidential Information”).

(b) The Customer must protect Dell’s Confidential Information in its possession or under its control by implementing protective physical and IT security measures at least to the same standards as it protects its own confidential information, and at all times with reasonable care.

(c) The Customer’s obligations under the above sub-clauses (a) and (b) will not apply to the extent the Customer can prove the relevant information: (i) was already lawfully in its possession free from any obligation of confidentiality at the time of receipt; (ii) is, now or in the future, public knowledge through no act or omission of the Customer or its employees, agents or contractors; (iii) was lawfully obtained from a third party having the right to disclose it free from any obligation of confidentiality; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by law (but the Customer shall notify Dell immediately of any such required disclosure).

8. Termination

(a) If the Customer commits any material breach of its obligations under the Agreement which is not capable of being remedied, then Dell may terminate the Agreement immediately by notice in writing.

(b) If a material breach is capable of being remedied, Dell shall give 14 days’ written notice of such breach. The Agreement may be terminated immediately on the provision of further written notice after such period if the Customer did not remedy the material breach to the reasonable satisfaction of Dell.

(c) Either party may terminate the Agreement on 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party.

Customer agrees that it will obtain all necessary rights, permissions and consents prior to disclosing any Personal Information to Dell.

10. Indemnification

a) Dell will indemnify and defend the Customer from any third-party claim that a Dell-branded Product: (i) breaches a Dell representation or warranty; (ii) violates applicable law; or (iii) causes death, bodily injury, or property damage to a third party if such death, bodily injury, or property damage is a direct result of Dell’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. Dell has no obligation under this clause for any claim to the extent it results from or arises out of the Customer’s or the Member’s modification of a Product or from any combination, operation, or use of the Products with any product other than those provided by Dell, or other use or misuse of the Products not in accordance with Dell’s or a third-party manufacturer’s specifications or the intended use of the Products. Dell will not settle any claim under this clause that requires the Customer’s monetary payment without the Customer's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Dell’s duty to indemnify the Customer under this clause is contingent upon Dell receiving prompt notice of a claim, and Dell’s right to solely control resolution of a claim.

(b) The Customer will indemnify and defend Dell from any third-party claim arising from or related to: (i) the Customer's representations, warranties or omissions; (ii) the Customer's alleged or actual negligence or violation of applicable law; (iii) death, bodily injury, or property damage to a third-party actually or allegedly caused in whole or in part by the actions or omissions of the Customer; (iv) the Customer’s wrongful use or disclosure of Dell’s Confidential Information; and (v) the Customer’s actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of any third party. The Customer will not settle any claim under this clause that obligates Dell to admit liability and/or act or cease to act in some manner without Dell's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

11. Exclusion of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable to the other for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, loss or corruption of data or other pecuniary loss, arising out of the performance or non-performance of its obligations under the Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damage arising.

12. Relationship of the Parties

The parties agree that the Agreement is not intended to create an agency relationship of any kind; and both parties agree not to contract any obligations in the name of the other, to use each other's credit, or to represent that the Customer is in the business of providing the products, goods and/or services provided by Dell. The Customer may not claim or imply that the Customer and Dell are legal partners or that Dell has sponsored, authorised, approved, or endorsed the Customer’s business or any offer or marketing, advertising, or promotion thereof in any manner.

13. Governing Law

The Agreement shall be governed by the laws of India and the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bangalore shall govern and construe the Agreement.

14. Modifications

Dell reserves the right to modify these Participation Terms or to cancel the Program at any time on reasonable prior notice to the Customer.

15. Entire Agreement

The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter.

Cookies and Web Beacons
What is a Cookie?

We use the word "cookies" to include a piece of text, pixels, clear GIFs, log files, web beacons or other tracing or tracking files or similar technology that are placed on your device. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device using a small text file. You can change the browser settings to reject cookies. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default because cookies make it easier for you to view certain content. Certain cookies are essential and strictly necessary to enable you to browse our websites and use their features. Without these cookies, services such as shopping baskets and e-billing cannot be provided. These cookies can be disabled at the browser level.

Why does Dell use Cookies?

Dell websites request cookies to be set on your device. We use cookies to let us know when you visit our websites, how you interact with us, to enrich your user experience, customise your relationship with Dell, including providing you with more relevant advertising and how you prefer to view content. For example, to help show you a localised website. We may also remember preferences such as text size and other customisable site elements.

Targeted Display Advertising

We work with trusted partners who use cookies to help us display more relevant content and appropriate communications to you when you visit Dell's and other websites. Our trusted partners may use cookie information gathered from your visits to Dell to deliver content via the internet, whether you are on a Dell website or another website. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of the content they deliver. Information in the cookies may tell them about what you have clicked, other actions you have taken on those pages, and the website from which you came.

Other cookies collect information about how you use websites, which pages you go to most, from which site you came, as well as what services you used or products you purchased. This helps us to improve our websites and make them easier for you to use.

To learn more about our partners, including how to control who your information is shared with, go to Dell's Privacy Notice.

Targeted Marketing by Dell

We and our partners may send you customised communications, based on your previous activities and your visits to Dell websites.

When you click on some links in communications you receive, our trusted partner may place a cookie on your browser. This cookie is then used to gather information about the products and services you view and purchase on Dell websites. It may also be used to provide more relevant communications to you in the future. Cookies placed by our trusted partners help us to measure the effectiveness of our interactions with you. You may choose to unsubscribe from our communications at any time by clicking on the link provided in every communication you receive.

How Dell Uses Web Beacons

A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognise a cookie on your device when you view a web page or email. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising. For example, web beacons may count the number of visitors to our website from a particular advertisement, or visitors who make a purchase from our website after viewing a particular communication. They may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may measure the effectiveness of our communications, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon a message. The web beacon will capture information about when a message is opened and how many times a message is forwarded.

Dell, or our trusted partners, may use web beacons on our websites, in our communications, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others' marketing. Similarly, third parties whose content or ads appear on Dell websites may also place web beacons in their ads or communications to measure how effective they are.

Web beacons allow us to recognise users by accessing Dell cookies. We may combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our interactions with you.

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.

How do I choose whether to receive cookies or not?

Alternatively, your browser settings should allow you to delete and/or disable website cookies. You may change your browser settings to notify you each time a website wants to place a cookie on your device. This lets you choose whether to accept or decline cookies from that website. Each browser will have its own way of giving you this option (for example, depending on whether you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome or other browser), so please consult your browser's "help" menu for further details.

If you choose to disable cookies, you may find the website does not work in the same way. You may find that disabling or rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain parts of the sites.

Some cookies are necessary to record and respect the choices you have made in regard to not being contacted or to not have other types of cookies added to your device.

If you delete cookies from your computer, the cookie used to recognise your choice will also be deleted requiring you to make your preference selection again.

Changes to Our Cookie Statement

We occasionally update this Cookie Statement. If we make any material changes to how we use cookies or how we treat information we have collected via cookies, we will reflect this in our Cookie Statement and revise the statement's effective date, included at the end of this section. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to remain informed of how Dell uses cookies.

Contacting Us

If you would like to contact us regarding our cookie statement, please email us at privacy@dell.com.

Cookie Statement Effective Date: 30 April 2014

Ads and Emails

Dell and our partners may use information about your visit to this and other websites. The information could include pages you visit, the items you view or place in your shopping cart, or your responses to our ads and emails. This information allows us to make the Dell ads you see more relevant to you. This is referred to as interest-based advertising. For example, if you recently looked at laptops online, you may be more likely to see an advertisement regarding a Dell laptop. For this purpose, Dell has selected partners who are members of self-regulatory associations such as the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).

To enable you to opt-out of interest-based advertising delivered by partners working with Dell, or to customise your experience on Dell websites, please visit Dell’s Manage Cookies. If you opt-out, you may still see Dell ads on Dell websites and other websites, but those ads will not be customized to you by Dell or our partners.

For more information on how Dell uses cookies and how to manage your cookie settings via your browser, please visit our Privacy Statement.

Please note that if you clear your cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you will be asked again to consent to the use of cookies and/or interest-based advertising, which may require you to reset your choices.

If you have questions, please contact us at privacy@Dell.com.

Forrester Consulting
Innovation leaders need automated IT services to transform
We believe it’s possible to make digital transformation real by innovating with services. Dell Technologies Services commissioned a Forrester Consulting study that validates the significant business impact of partnering with the right IT service providers for deployment and support. The findings show that 74% of ITDMs agree they cannot meet their organization’s demand for IT expertise with internal resources only. What’s holding you back from getting the support you need?
