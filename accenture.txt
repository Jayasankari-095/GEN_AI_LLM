For example, in 2020, we established a 2025 carbon removal goal—previously referred to as our 2025 net-zero goal—and we are on track to achieve this goal.
Our environment goals span three areas: reducing and removing our carbon emissions, moving toward zero waste and planning for water risk.
Climate change mitigation
Carbon reduction
Carbon removal
Toward zero waste
Water risk
Alliance for Clean Air
We continue to work toward our 2025 carbon removal goal by first focusing on reductions across our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and then removing any remaining emissions through nature-based carbon removal projects.
We are a signatory to the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C Pledge, committing to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5° Celsius in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
In 2018, we established a SBTi 2025 near-term emissions reduction target, which we have surpassed. During fiscal 2024, we received SBTi approval for net-zero GHG emissions targets aligned with SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard, including new 2030 near-term and 2040 long-term reduction targets.
Learn more about our commitment to the environment, including our actions to reduce GHG emissions and related disclosures.

Accenture accessibility statement
Accenture believes that enterprises have a powerful role to play in ensuring technology helps bridge the divide for people with disabilities. Providing increased access to technologies that meet the needs of persons with disabilities lays the foundation for inclusive work cultures that enable these employees to thrive.
To support this belief, we strive to make accenture.com as accessible as possible to people of all levels of ability. As our guide across the site we use the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. Our goal is for accenture.com to meet Level AA standards, WCAG’s recommended level of conformance for entire sites.
We consider the WCAG 2.2 Level AA guidelines as we build our platform and pages. With this guidance in mind, we:
Design site templates with an emphasis on color contrast, logical heading order, and configurable repeated elements.
  Code the templates to ensure pages are usable by a variety of input and output devices, such as keyboard navigation and screen readers.
  Ensure that all non-textual elements have a text equivalent (such as “alt text” for images or transcripts for videos).
We regularly measure our site using a variety of methods, such as browser plug-ins, external vendor assessments, and individual page testing by our own Global IT Accessibility practice. This continuous approach helps ensure that accessibility will be maintained as guidelines change and technology evolves. We view our overall site and platform as meeting Level AA conformance, while recognizing that some pages may have occasional accessibility errors. If you see any errors, or have other suggestions on how we can further improve the accessibility of our site, please contact us at accessibility@accenture.com.
In addition to building new pages of accenture.com with accessibility in mind, Accenture looks to embed accessibility forethought into everyday technology and content design. Our Global IT Accessibility practice is designing a work experience to help all employees feel that they belong, personally and professionally, and contribute to a culture of equality. A major component of this effort is creating accessibility in the workplace that removes barriers for persons with disabilities—both hidden and visible, so they can succeed.
At Accenture, we work to empower persons with disabilities every day.

Sorry about the inconvenience. Please try allowing the Foresight app to run in the background in the app settings. This will stop the app from closing and restarting as you toggle to get the one-time passcode from Gmail. We look forward to your follow-up. Please provide more detail if possible.

Wherever you are, you’ll work at the heart of change
We strive to create exceptional workplace culture experiences by building connection and community, and providing the flexibility we all need in work and life to support our well-being and productivity.
View Transcript
Flex and connect
Flexibility extends beyond where you work—to what you do and when and how you do it. For all of us, making connections is a key part of flexible working. We believe in its power to build strong relationships and innovate to create change.
Accenture workplace: be empowered
Where, when and how you work will vary based on your role and location. These guidelines are here to support us all—and 85% of our people say they feel empowered to work flexibly.
Make work work for you
Flexible work arrangements can be formal (which may be part of your contract) or informal (which you’ll arrange with your lead).
Form connections in real life
Your relationships with your local team and Accenture community are part of what makes working here special. All our people experience in-person collaboration (ranging in frequency from daily to quarterly) to learn, share knowledge, and build connections with clients, colleagues and leaders.
Be present with clients
If you’re in a client-facing role, you’ll connect with your client at least three days a week—either in-person or virtually. Depending on the nature of your work and the proximity of team members, we encourage prioritizing in-person meetings and collaboration.
You’re welcome here
We live our belief that a diverse workforce is a better workforce. We actively hire people from diverse backgrounds and different perspectives. When all of our unique experiences come together, we can innovate and reinvent anything. Find out how we’re taking action to be the world’s most inclusive company.
See our communities
Working with integrity
Read the code of business ethics
We share a commitment to working with the highest ethical standards and making positive change in all we do. Here are three essential parts of our code. 
Make your conduct count
Making your conduct count is about fostering respect, fairness and shared ethical values and describes behaviors that we expect from—and for—our people so that they can be at their best each day.
Protect people, information and our business
We work together to build a better, stronger company for future generations, protecting the Accenture brand, information, intellectual property and our people.
Be a good corporate citizen
We support and respect human rights, foster environmental responsibility and encourage our people's involvement in the communities where we work and live.

Infrastructure & Capital Projects
Expand Menu
Plan, manage and execute capital projects efficiently
Combine human ingenuity with data and AI to deliver large-scale projects on time and within budget, while also achieving broader investment and sustainability objectives.
Why reinvent capital projects?
Government policies, manufacturing shifts, energy transition and aging infrastructure mean project demand is surging. Yet with siloed operations, workforce challenges and fragmented processes, owners are struggling to deliver projects that meet project objectives. By combining strategy, data and utilizing direct support on the ground you can address today’s challenges and help build a better world for the future.
DATA
Toggle accordion
9 of 10
construction projects have cost overruns — regularly up to 50%
How AI is changing infrastructure and capital projects
AI can get you closer to ‘on time’ and ‘on budget’
Imagine having reliable insights for quick decision making. Or automation that improves efficiency in contracts, workflows, and reporting. Picture being able to test different design and execution options to perfect plans and solve construction issues before starting work onsite. Think about the added security from better compliance and risk detection. AI provides the necessary support to deliver project performance.
What you can do
Define your strategy from the start
Get skilled support where you need it most
Digitize your processes
Gain total project visibility with data
Breakdown siloes and promote collaboration across the project ecosystem
Design with sustainability in mind and reduce costly rework and waste
What you’ll achieve
Projects delivered with desired outcomes
Program and project delivery teams, project controls processes and digital tools deliver greater analysis, schedule control and portfolio or program efficiency.
A safer, more efficient worksite
Increase visibility with digital construction management tools that connects workers, materials and machinery. Real-time monitoring of workers and assets increase field productivity and time on productive tasks.
