Awful tech support and driver communication
My original fair of about $45 for my ride had already come out of my account for my destination and a day or so later, I noticed the money back in my account. I couldn’t think of what it was from so I went on about my day.

I love this app however…….
I love using Uber however regardless of how much I have on my voucher a lot of the time it is asking for my debit card, when this is going on I have over $100 dollars or more. Also the thing is this it isn’t like the voucher is not covering every single ride. I was told this is a glitch. Well the thing is I cannot afford to have this as an ongoing issue due to the fact that is how I am utilizing disability services. One time I was waiting on a ride and someone else took it. There was a time this month a driver canceled a ride even though I was already in her car. I get that may sound odd but I would have not canceled the ride being that I was already picked up. After the ride showed up as canceled I had noticed some of my voucher was already taken off. I have my county board of developmental disabilities giving me vouchers every month. When there is issues with these vouchers it causes me emotional distress. I have contacted the board, I have contacted the company that supplies the vouchers to the board and they have said reach out to Uber about a lot of issues. I am worried that at some point that if the vouchers are not going through that is going to screw me and a bunch of other people over. I do not have an option to get my driver’s license ( long story). I get that there is only so much that can be done. Thank you for providing transportation and customer service.

Uber reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that Uber determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.
USER PROVIDED CONTENT.
Uber may, in Uber’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to Uber through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions (“User Content”). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to Uber, you grant Uber a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Uber’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity. You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Uber the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor Uber’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Uber in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. Uber may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at Uber’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.
NETWORK ACCESS AND DEVICES.
You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device and you shall be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. Uber does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.
4. PAYMENT
You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from Uber and / or a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services, Uber will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges received on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of such Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. All Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Uber reserves the right to charge you amounts for, among others, applicable tolls, fees and charges incurred for the provision of services by the Third Party Providers, charges for the Services, pickup facility provided at various places, each along with applicable taxes (including but not limited to GST). Please note that Uber shall determine the city in which your trip commences as your address on record of Uber, wherever available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Uber. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Uber will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Uber using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Uber will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Uber may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. As between you and Uber, Uber reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Uber’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Uber will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Uber may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers, subscriptions and discounts that may result in discounted amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers,subscriptions and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to compensate the Third Party Provider and Uber for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Uber does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Uber (on Uber’s website, in the Application, or in Uber’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Uber provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.
REPAIR OR CLEANING FEES.
You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Third Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal “wear and tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”). In the event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Uber in Uber’s reasonable discretion, Uber reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will be transferred by Uber to the applicable Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.

UBER GUIDELINES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES
The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about the legal process for seeking records from Uber. These are merely guidelines, and this information may change at any time. For private party requests, including requests from civil litigants and criminal defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests.
WHAT IS UBER AND WHAT RECORDS DO WE HAVE?
Uber is a technology company that has developed an app that connects users (riders) with driver partners who provide transportation to the user. Uber is not a transportation carrier, and does not employ any drivers. Users can use the Uber App to request transportation via their smartphone, the web, or via SMS. Uber users can choose from a variety of drivers available in his or her location. At the end of the ride, both the driver partner and user receive a copy of the fare receipt. More information about our services is available here. We store and maintain information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of Use.
WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL PROCESS DOES UBER REQUIRE BEFORE PRODUCING USER OR PARTNER INFORMATION?
For U.S. Law Enforcement We require valid and sufficient legal process before we can disclose business records regarding partners, users, or trips. In most instances, we won’t be able to provide any information without a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We accept law enforcement requests via email to LERT@uber.com or via personal service through our corporate agent, National Registered Agents, Inc., 818 W. Seventh Street, Suite 930, Los Angeles, California 90017. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections Uber may have and may raise in response to the request.
For Non-U.S. Law Enforcement: We disclose business records only in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A valid U.S. court order (via mutual legal assistance treaty, mutual legal assistance agreement, or letter rogatory) may be required to compel disclosure of certain records. We accept non-US requests via email to LERT@uber.com or via personal service to the following address: Uber B.V., Regus Business Platinum Centre Pvt. Ltd., Level 13, Platinum Techno Park, Plot No.17/18, Sec-30A, Vashi, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra- 400705. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections Uber B.V. may have and may raise in response to the request.
WHAT FORM OF REQUESTS DOES UBER REQUIRE, AND HOW ARE REQUESTS PROCESSED?
To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable process described above, as well as a valid return email address from an official government domain. We review each request for facial and substantive validity, and will reject requests that are not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement need and will reject overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make sure your Law Enforcement Request is valid and does not seek more information than necessary, we ask for the following: A sufficiently narrow/defined time period; A specific event or action that the subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a user or driver partner) We disclose data to law enforcement when we determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we will search for and disclose data that we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.
HOW DOES UBER HANDLE EMERGENCY REQUESTS?
We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where there is an emergency that involves protecting a user, driver partner, or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. Requestors must submit an Emergency Request Form (which can be requested through LERT@uber.com) that describes in detail the nature of the emergency, and we review these requests on a case-by- case basis. Law enforcement can submit an emergency request by emailing LERT@uber.com. Please note that we will only review and respond to emergency requests from law enforcement, and will not respond to emergency requests sent to this address by non-law enforcement officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an emergency situation should immediately and directly contact local law enforcement officials.
DOES UBER NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO THEM?
Yes, we may notify subjects before producing their information to law enforcement, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so, or in exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.
DOES UBER PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION OR EXPERT TESTIMONY?
We may provide a certification from our records custodian but are not generally able to provide in-person or expert witness testimony. Law enforcement officials with questions about these guidelines should email LERT@uber.com. Please note that we will not respond to non-law enforcement inquiries received at this email address. For non-law enforcement inquiries, please see Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests.

Just got a free month of Uber One, I've been ordering more than usual. The app is near unusable. It often fails to save my selections when I customize items, so more than once I've ended up paying for an item I just throw away. And Uber makes complaints really difficult. The most they offer is a $5 credit which never covers the cost of the item. I'm waiting now for them to credit back the rest of an order, which they may just never do and then I'm out $15. Unacceptable.

I'm giving two stars because you have recently re-implemented the idea of having to walk to some random location to get a shared ride to save a couple of bucks. This is not only unacceptable simply because some of us have mobility issues and can't walk to random locations, but also because a woman walking by herself late at night to some random location to save a couple of bucks faces an increased risk of getting abducted/raped as a result. Please revert back for the safety of your riders!

Don't count on Uber if your ride is time sensitive. I requested ride to dealership to get my personal work vehicle. Ride was tasked to a new driver by app multiple times, delaying my arrival . When atempteing to reach out to support, I spent an hour with bots, then was redirected to website. I had to put in a request for missing item to get directed to a person who then escalated. Once escalated to a person, all they could offer was the scheduling feature. Thankfully Lyft is popular in my area.

Enter destination
See prices
A quick guide to Uber
Here’s how the Uber app and Uber.com connect drivers and riders on demand, step by step:
1. Getting started
The rider enters their destination into the “Where to?” or “Dropoff location” box, reviews each ride option, makes their selection, and confirms the pickup.
2. Matching rider and driver
A nearby driver accepts the rider’s ride request. The rider is automatically notified as the driver gets close.
3. Picking up
The driver and the rider verify each other’s names and the destination. Then the driver starts the ride.
4. Taking the trip
The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn directions.
5. Leaving ratings and reviews
At the end of each trip, drivers and riders can rate each other from 1 to 5 stars. Riders also have the option to tip directly in the app or online. And in some countries, riders can choose to give their driver compliments.

Driving autonomous forward
At Uber, it's our mission to reimagine the way the world moves for the better—and it's clear that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will play a part in our future. With that in mind, we have been building Uber for the road ahead.
Innovation that’s ready for today and tomorrow
The light bulb and the power grid. The automobile and highways. Smartphones and Uber. Where would these groundbreaking innovations be without the others that enabled their full potential?
Progress needs a partner. For autonomous vehicles, that partner is Uber. As the largest on-demand mobility and delivery platform in the world, alongside our deep expertise in marketplace management, fleet utilization, and local operations—we’re uniquely positioned to help AV hardware and software developers deploy and scale their technology globally. And together, we’ll continue to move the world forward with autonomous solutions that work for us all.
Mobility
Autonomous vehicles and human drivers together on one platform means the right ride for every customer is always within reach.
Delivery
Getting almost anything on Uber Eats can become even easier and more affordable with deliveries from all-electric sidewalk robots and autonomous cars.
1/2
Driven together
Uber’s hybrid model
We imagine a future where autonomous vehicles and human drivers seamlessly work together to make transportation more reliable, affordable, sustainable, and safer. Our vision is one of a shared, electric, and multimodal future, with AVs operating alongside drivers and couriers, each bringing their unique capabilities to the table.
Meet our partners
We’ve teamed up with industry leaders who share our values and believe in the potential for autonomous technology to create positive outcomes for our communities. And with exciting programs already launched with key players across the globe, we’re driving the future of autonomous transportation forward, together.
Standing for safety
As we introduce more autonomous vehicle partners onto our platform and into your communities, safety will always be a top priority. We carefully review our partners' approaches to safety before they can operate on the Uber platform.

This notice specifically applies if you:
Request or receive mobility services, including rides and package delivery and return services through Uber Connect, via your Uber account (a “Rider”).
Request or receive food or other products and services for delivery or pickup, including via your Uber Eats or Postmates account, or through the guest checkout features that allow you to access delivery or pickup services without creating and/or signing into your account (an “Order Recipient”).
Receive services through Uber’s apps or websites requested by other account owners (a “Guest User”), including if you receive ride or delivery services ordered by Uber Health, Central, Uber Direct or Uber for Business customers (collectively, “Enterprise Customers”); or by friends, family members or other individual account owners, including via Uber Connect; or receive a gift card. 
Rent a vehicle through Uber Car Rentals (a “Renter”).
This notice does not describe Uber’s collection and use of your data if you use Uber to provide (instead of request or receive) services through Uber’s app or websites, including as a driver or delivery person. Uber’s notice describing our collection and use of such data is available here. Those who use Uber to either request, receive or provide services are referred to as “users” in this notice.
Our privacy practices are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. The types of data processing that such laws require, allow, or prohibit vary globally. Therefore, if you travel across national, state or other geographic borders, Uber's data processing practices described in this notice may differ from those in your home country or territory.

C. Core automated processes
Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our services, including functions essential to our business such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.
Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.
This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.
You may contact Uber here if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.
1. Matching
Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match Riders and drivers, or delivery people and Order Recipients. This helps us minimize wait times for you, and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.
The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries through Uber. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether the specific Rider and driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).
The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.
We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.
Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available here.
2. Pricing
When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:
The type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black)
Your location
Estimated time and distance to destination
Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
Time of day
Traffic conditions
Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends.
Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.
The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available here.
3. Fraud prevention and detection
Uber uses algorithms and machine learning models to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.
These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.
Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.
You may contact Uber customer support here if you have questions or concerns about these processes.
D. Cookies and related technologies
Uber and its partners use cookies and other identification technologies on our apps, websites, emails, and online ads for purposes described in this notice, and Uber’s Cookie Notice.

B. Our legal bases for using your data
Depending on where you use our services, and our purpose for using your data, Uber relies on the following legal bases for processing your data:
Necessity to perform our contract with you
Consent
Uber's legitimate interests
Legal obligation
Data protection laws in some countries and areas, including the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Brazil and Nigeria, only allow Uber to use your data when certain circumstances defined under those laws apply.

The chart below indicates the legal bases that Uber has under those laws when they do apply, and it uses your data for the purposes described in this notice.
Legal basis

That’s our commitment to every person on the planet, and we’ll do everything in our power to get there. The path will be electric and shared. It will be with buses, trains, bicycles, and scooters. It will mean helping people move, order meals, and send things using options that are more sustainable. These changes won’t come easily, and they will take work and time to achieve. But we have a plan to get there, and we want you to come along for the ride.
2020
Announced global commitment to becoming a zero-emission mobility platform.
2023
Expanded global commitment to include zero-emission delivery trips and promote the transition to more-sustainable packaging options.

80% of restaurant orders with Uber Eats across European and Asia Pacific cities are transitioned from single-use plastics to reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging options.
2030

Sustainability
Uber is committing to becoming a fully electric, zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking place in zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with micromobility. It is our responsibility as the largest mobility platform in the world to more aggressively tackle the challenge of climate change. We will do this by offering riders more ways to ride green, helping drivers go electric, making transparency a priority and partnering with NGOs and the private sector to help expedite a clean and just energy transition.

Rides and beyond
In addition to helping riders find a way to go from point A to point B, we're helping people order food quickly and affordably, removing barriers to healthcare, creating new freight-booking solutions, and helping companies provide a seamless employee travel experience. And always helping drivers and couriers earn.

We also connect consumers and restaurants, grocers, and other merchants so they can buy and sell meals, groceries, and other items, then we match them with independent delivery service providers. Plus, Uber connects shippers and carriers in the freight industry.

This is a promotional offer and is not a promise or guarantee of future earnings. This offer is available only to new drivers and delivery people on the Uber app who (i) have never previously signed up to drive or deliver with Uber; (ii) receive this offer directly from Uber and see it in the guarantee tracker of the Uber Driver app; (iii) are cleared to drive or deliver with Uber; and (iv) complete the number of trips or deliveries displayed in the guarantee tracker in the city where they signed up to drive within the specified timeframe. Offer terms such as number of trips or deliveries and reward amount may vary by location. The guarantee offer that you see in the app replaces any guarantee amounts Uber previously offered you.
Earnings from your trips (after services fees and certain charges are deducted, such as city or local government charges) are included toward your guaranteed amount; any tips and promotions you make are on top of that amount. Earnings from your deliveries (after services fees and certain charges are deducted, such as city or local government charges) and Eats Boost promotions are included toward your offer amount; any tips and additional promotions you make are on top of that amount.
Any payment due will be automatically added to your account after you complete the required trips. Each completed trip or delivery counts as one trip or delivery toward your minimum requirement. Canceled trips or deliveries do not count. This offer is only valid for those who received it from Uber (via an email, an ad, a web page, or a unique referral link) and meet the eligibility requirements. Uber reserves the right to withhold or deduct payments that it determines or believes were fraudulent, illegal, in error, or in violation of the driver terms or these terms. Limited time only. Offer and terms are subject to change.
