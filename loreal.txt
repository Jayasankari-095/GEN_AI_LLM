The brand that empowers women through beauty products and services
Visit loreal-paris.com
L'Oréal Consumer Products Division L'Oréal Paris
L’Oréal Paris is more than a beauty brand, it’s a brand that empowers women to recognize their true self-worth.
Our mission is to remove all the barriers standing between women and their ambitions and to drive social and environmental progress to benefit everyone. Our Stand Up program is training people around the world against street harassment and L'Oréal Paris is lowering environmental impact under the L’Oréal Group’s sustainability targets Sharing Beauty With All.
Delphine Viguier-Hovasse
L'Oréal Paris Global Brand President

Rooted in Science
Its pioneering science is based on the deepest knowledge thanks to its 4 000 researchers and 21 scientific research centers around a world. Across intensive researches and biggest data samples, the superior performance of L’Oréal Paris is rooted in science at scale to deliver to each woman in her singularity with visible proven results.
Because the quest for responsible innovation is part of our DNA, L’Oréal Paris goes further by capitalizing on social, environmental and economic responsible commitments. Since 1989 and 14 years before regulations required, we stopped animal-testing for our ingredients thanks to Episkin®, an innovation pillar created by our experts in cell biology & tissue engineering 30 years ago that we share with the whole industry, and continue to spread and to make available to anyone worldwide, even competitors.
Furthermore, we believe in green chemistry and biotechnology to continue to provide women with the best performing actives, technologies, and services, to design the 360° beauty of the future.
I believe it's so important to build confidence in women from a young age, and to role model diverse perspectives of beauty. To now be part of a brand that has been challenging women's worth for more than 40 years and to use my voice to help empower others is truly surreal.

With Mugler, the real world just isn't enough
Mugler is a brand with no boundaries, that refuses compromise and consensus. A fashion and fragrances brand from today, built on a bold & unconventional legacy, that helps us reinvent ourselves constantly.
We want Mugler fragrances to be the disruptive voice of the selective industry: with surprising & unique juices, bold and singular bottles, strong and supercharged communication campaigns.
We believe in a Luxury with a positive impact.
Since Day one, we believed/thought that economic success also goes with a positive contribution to society and its ability to respond to the main environmental issues.
Because our fragrance bottles are iconic, and created as piece of arts, they are forever refillable at the Fountain, a unique service in Perfumery, or at home with our refill bottles.
We celebrate individuality and diversity, creating a vibrant community that people want to be part of. With Mugler you can become the supercharged version of yourself.
We are passionate and we believe that joy, energy, and audacity will change the world.
Danièle Lahana-Aidenbaum
Global Brand President MUGLER Fashion & Fragrances
Responsible Luxury
Mugler has always created fragrances with a different, more responsible idea of luxury. Starting in 1992 with Angel, its first fragrance for women, the brand was a true pioneer, upsetting the obsolescent codes with its lifetime bottles that could be refilled at the Mugler Fountain or topped up with separate refill bottles.
Today, a bottle is refilled every twenty-five seconds around the world.
This same approach and ethical belief is also taken for the choice of ingredients, ensuring the safeguarding and preservation of ecosystems, the resilience of the supply chain and fair remuneration for producers.

Create daring beauty that dresses change
Visit yslbeauty.com
L'Oréal L'Oréal Luxe YSL Beauty
AN UNBRIDLED LOVE AFFAIR WITH SELF-EXPRESSION
M. Saint Laurent once said, “I contributed to the transformation of my  era”. Today we honor this heritage, by pushing the boundaries, playing with tensions and creating daring beauty that dresses change. A Parisian chic elegance, bold and unapologetic, igniting the vision that everyone can draw their own definition of beauty with a confident stroke. Because true confidence isn’t found in a mirror, it’s ignited from within. Audacious and modern, in the here and now, YSL Beauty empowers you to live life by your own rules, no compromises.
Stephan Bezy
International General Manager Yves Saint Laurent Beauty
THE OURIKA COMMUNITY GARDENS: A PLACE OF CHANGE, A CULTURE OF BEAUTY. TODAY AND FOR THE FUTURE.
SINCE 2014, NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF MOROCCO'S ATLAS MOUNTAINS, YVES SAINT LAURENT BEAUTY HAS CULTIVATED THE OURIKA COMMUNITY GARDENS, A UNIQUE PLACE DRIVING POSITIVE CHANGE AND ECHOING M. SAINT LAURENT'S PROFOUND CONNECTION TO THE REGION THAT TODAY IS A SOURCE OF KEY BOTANICALS FOR PRODUCTS. MOROCCO PROVIDED ENDLESS INSPIRATION FOR THE COUTURIER, CAPTIVATING HIM WITH ITS VIBRANT COLORS AND SERENE LANDSCAPES, A STARK CONTRAST TO PARISIAN LIFE. INSPIRED BY THIS RICH HERITAGE, YSL BEAUTY ESTABLISHED THIS PROGRAM IN THE OURIKA VALLEY WHICH EMPOWERS A LOCAL FEMALE-LED COLLECTIVE THROUGH EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION.
FOR OVER A DECADE, THIS BOTANICAL AND OLFACTORY LABORATORY HAS SERVED AS A WELLSPRING OF INNOVATION, DEVELOPING CUTTING-EDGE BEAUTY SOLUTIONS IN HARMONY WITH BOTH PEOPLE AND THE PLANET. JUST AS THE MOROCCAN LANDSCAPE INSPIRED M. SAINT LAURENT'S DESIGNS, THE OURIKA GARDENS CONTINUE THIS LEGACY, TRANSFORMING THE LAND INTO A THRIVING SOURCE OF INGREDIENTS FOR YSL BEAUTY WHICH WEAVE SUSTAINABILITY INTO THE CREATION OF PRODUCTS FROM FRAGRANCE TO MAKEUP AND SKINCARE.
ABUSE IS NOT LOVE IS YSL BEAUTY'S GLOBAL INITIATIVE DEDICATED TO PREVENTING AND COMBATTING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV), THE MOST WIDESPREAD FORM OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. WITH 1 IN 3 WOMEN EXPERIENCING IPV IN THEIR LIFETIME—WHETHER SEXUAL, PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, OR FINANCIAL—THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON EDUCATING INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THE NINE WARNING SIGNS OF ABUSE. CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN MORE THAN 5 CONTINENTS, ABUSE IS NOT LOVE AIMS TO EDUCATE 2 MILLION PEOPLE GLOBALLY BY 2030. THE INITIATIVE IS BUILT ON FOUR KEY PILLARS: SUPPORTING LOCAL NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, EDUCATING YSL BEAUTY TEAMS WORLDWIDE, CONTRIBUTING TO THOUGHT LEADERSHIP THROUGH ACADEMIC RESEARCH, AND WIDE SCALE AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS.

shu uemura heritage
"Makeup is fashion for the face"
Mr. Shu Uemura
A pioneer, an innovator, a visionary.
Mr. Shu Uemura is the origin of the brand. Beyond a makeup artist, he was a pionner, an innovator, a visionary.
Born in Tokyo in 1928, he was the first Japanese makeup artist in Hollywood. He was striving to liberate beauty with his cutting-edge makeup artistry born from unimaginable creativity, producing high-quality products and crafted-in-japan quality tools that have been astonishing the world ever since.
To this day, shu uemura conveys a uniquely Japanese sensitivity towards beauty: an obsession with quality, precision, attention to details, while expressing its Japanese heritage with modernity. These are the origins of his unwavering passion as a beauty innovator.
Empowering self-exploration
The founder, Mr. Shu Uemura, is known as a man who elevated beauty into a state of art. His pioneering spirit, innovative ideas, artistic mind, creativity, and unbridable passion for creating something beautiful fuse into a form of art, shaping our past, present, and future. 
Our beauty journey with Mr.Shu Uemura continues with his spirits and visions coming to life and discovering a new realm of beauty we have never seen before.
  Gaetane Gaudry
shu uemura brand president worldwide
  ”I would like to dedicate to all the pleasure of enjoying makeup with free spirits. Find your own unique beauty by enhancing your personality. You will be even more beautiful if you enjoy makeup with freedom”
Shu Uemura
Founder
Beauty brings joy to people
"shu uemura has been known as the first international makeup artist brand from Japan. Without a doubt, shu uemura is a rich brand, and it goes beyond just a variety of unique products, shades, tools, makeup artistry… We have a professional spirit, and there is reason and logic behind everything we do, such as why we need those particular products, shades, makeup application techniques, customer service and so on.
It constitutes our DNA and it allowed us to thrive for over 50 years as an international cosmetic brand. I strongly believe that beauty brings joy to people. I feel it is like a sustaining force in our life.
shu uemura aims to provide cutting-edge makeup artistry based on Japanese aesthetics and stands alongside Asian millennials to encourage their self-expression and help them find their own individual beauty."

Life-changing dermatology for sensitive skin
Visit Laroche-posay.com
L'Oréal Dermatological Beauty Division La Roche-Posay
At La Roche-Posay, we look at skin and we see people. People worth fighting for, innovating for, daring for.
The skin is more than just an envelope, it is a vital organ that plays a strong role in people’s lives and well-being. When we see skin, we see people worth fighting and daring for.

We strongly believe no one should be left aside because of skin problems, skin differences, skin colors or scars of life. From eczema to acne, skin aging, allergic skin reactions or skin side effects of cancer treatments, no challenge is too big for us. We will continue to push the limits of dermatology to change people’s lives.
Laetitia Toupet
La Roche-Posay International General Manager
Committed to Dermatology & Innovation
La Roche-Posay has been pioneering dermatology since its creation in 1975, working in close partnership with dermatologists. The brand conducted more than 600 clinical studies on 90,000 patients, from newborns to 104-year-olds, of different ethnicities and varied skin pathologies (acne, allergic skin, eczema, under cancer treatment, wounds, post-esthetic treatment, etc.).
Beyond its products, La Roche-Posay aims to make dermatology accessible to people through health tech. In 2016, the brand launched the first stretchable skin sensor to monitor UV exposure. In 2019, La Roche-Posay launched Effaclar Spotscan, the first web app co-developed by dermatologists and based on artificial intelligence to analyze acne-prone skin and provide personalized advice and recommendations. Additionally, the brand introduced My Skin Track UV in partnership with Apple, a battery-free wearable sensor and companion app to measure UV, pollution, pollen and humidity exposure and provide personalised advice.

Augmented traditional Chinese beauty

Yuesai: a Chinese icon
“ WITHIN YOU LIES THE POWER TO ATTAIN BEAUTY, HEALTH AND SUCCESS, YOU MAKE THE CHOICE, THUS YOU CREATE YOUR OWN DESTINY. ”

Yue-Sai KAN is worldly known as a media maven, a successful enterpreneur, a best-selling author and a humanitarian. With the conviction that every Chinese woman can attain beauty, health and success, in 1992, she founded Yuesai Beauty that introduced millions of women to cosmetics in China. The brand became a household name, as proclaimed by Forbes : “Yue-Sai changed the face of the Middle kingdom, one lipstick at a time.”

Today, Yuesai remains determined to create luxurious, quality and essential beauty products for Chinese women, so they have the ability to look beautiful, have confidence and pride to venture on different milestones of womanhood.
Yuesai
Founder of Yuesai
100% natural origin, TCM are extracted and augmented with green chemistry extraction to preserve its purity with sustainability.
They are encapsulated with cutting-edge formulation to allow absorption into different skin layers.
Each of Yuesai’s selective products are evaluated and proven to regulate and repair on 4 dimensions of skin quality of chinese women : tone, texture, tonicity and translucency.

Ganoderma: Yuesai's Finest Ingredient
Ganoderma has been used as a medicinal mushroom in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. It grows only in the subtropical Chinese regions swept periodically by torrential and grueling monsoons. What make Ganoderma so precious is its rarity, vulnerability, and harvesting process; it takes 3 to 4 years to grow, sheltered and nourished by the shade of centennial trees and fertile moss.
Ganoderma can only be harvested in one specific period of the year when it releases its spores, which contain the most powerful properties, for a period of less than a month.
Among its numerous beneficial effects, Ganoderma has been scientifically proven to have extraordinary revitalizing properties, which is the reason why Yuesai chose it as its star ingredient.
VITALIZE GANODERMA, YOUTH PRESERVING TONER
Ganoderma is the main ingredient of Yuesai’s best selling product. The revitalizing properties of this fungus reactivate the energy flow of the skin so to restore its natural sheen. Applied after cleansing, Ganoderma toner stabilizes skin condition to improve resilience, reestablish natural clarity, and reveal inner glow.

Vichy Laboratoires
Health is vital. Start with your skin.
Visit vichy.com
L'Oréal Dermatological Beauty Division Vichy Laboratoires
At Vichy, we believe that health is vital. And that it starts with the skin.
I feel honored to join such an inspiring division where health is the future of Beauty. And I'm proud to lead Vichy, an iconic dermo-cosmetic brand rooted in science and at the forefront of medical beauty, recommended by more than 70,000 dermatologists worldwide.
It will now be my duty to push the limits of skin health even further and continue the success story!
        VINCENT CHAUVIÈRE
VICHY GLOBAL BRAND PRESIDENT
    Pioneer skin exposome science
Skin’s health has always been a quest for Vichy. Our expertise relies on the comprehensive study of the elements that affect its evolution over time. We now know that a skin condition is the combination of multiple influences: environmental, behavioral, and hormonal. And, above all: it’s their cumulative effect that can disrupt the skin’s biological functions and accelerate its ageing. In 2016, we turned these discoveries into a pioneering science:  Skin Exposome Science. 
This science led us to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to dermo-cosmetic, combining Dermatology with other medical fields (Endocrinology, Nutrition, Neuroscience, and Environmental medicine…). Thus, we can address the visible symptoms of certain skin dysfunctions, by prescribing products, which efficacy is tested in real life condition. Our protocols consist of powerful combinations of dermatological actives developed in hypoallergenic formulations, and health habit recommendations endorsed by our multi-disciplinary medical board. This global approach helps women to take action to counteract Exposome factors that accelerate their skin’s aging process.
Vichy is committed to gaining a better understanding on Exposome factors and their influence on skin’s health, and supports this highly important area of research at the international level through our annual Vichy Exposome Grant.

Maybelline New York
The number one makeup brand in the world
Visit maybelline.com
L'Oréal Consumer Products Division Maybelline
Maybelline New York was born with a spark in 1917
Maybelline New York was born with a spark in 1917 when Mabel Williams singed her lashes in a cooking fire— and turned disaster into opportunity by mixing the ashes with Vaseline to create a mascara product for all.
100 years later, that Maybelline spirit lives on, in the spark and spirit of New York. 
Every product we make lives up to our values: Diverse. Hardworking. No-hassle. On the pulse. We create makeup that brings the fashion sensibility and pulse of New York City to the world.  
This vision has propelled us to become the number one global makeup brand in over 120 countries. As our global community continues to grow, we are committed to helping everyone, everywhere look -- and feel -- ready to take on their world.

High potency formulas
SkinCeuticals was born from decades of skin cancer research that led to pivotal breakthroughs in antioxidants. Our high potency formulas are concentrated in pure actives and proven to absorb optimally into skin. Our clinical-grade skincare is used by dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and medi-spas for daily homecare and to complement aesthetic procedures.
The Origin of SkinCeuticals
“Skin is naturally built for repair. When bombarded by environmental assaults, skin must focus on neutralizing oxidative damage, limiting its capacity for reparative functions. Daily use of pure vitamin c antioxidants, when properly formulated to penetrate skin, protect against damage, enhancing self-repair to reduce signs of aging.”
Dr. Sheldon Pinell
Founder and Scientist
Explore Why Medical Professionals Use SkinCeuticals
Our Integrated Skincare approach is centered on the belief that a precise combination of clinical in-office procedures, professional treatments, and an advanced homecare regimen is the ideal recipe for healthy, youthful-looking skin. For this reason, we formulate our skincare for maximum efficacy alone, and as a complement to office-based treatments for enhanced outcomes.

Clinical grounded, mindful to customer. This is TAKAMI.
Acquired in 2021 to join L'Oréal Luxe, Takami is the first-ever Japanese clinic-native skincare brand of our portfolio.
Clinic-born, Tokyo-made, Takami is a mission-driven company united around 3 core values :
Clinic-born: We trust what we can touch - the skin of our 410,000 patients. We are Keratin Dermatology pioneers and serve Asian skin.
Minimal: the roots of our Skinpeel essence - We obsess over only the essentials : shorter regimens, more essential ingredients, softer gestures.
Loyal: the everyday obsession of our teams - like a doctor-on-call, we believe in the power of beauty habits, persistent coaching, and lifelong relationships.
Clinic-grounded, understated in its values, mindful to customers, Takami is designed for function and lifetime relationship. As the founder used to say, “We are the cosmetics that you want to keep for long”.

Biotech-powered for 30 years
Biotherm was created in 1952 based on the discovery of vitreoscilla filiformis, a plankton with superior skin-regenerating properties. An exceptional living ingredient but incredibly fragile and difficult to work with.
In 1994, Biotherm’s biologists developed the first biotech process ever applied to skincare to harness the full power of this unique plankton in their formulas.
Through biotech, Biotherm's original plankton is purified and concentrated to 400,000 times its natural strength. This 100% natural ingredient, now known as Biotech Plankton™, delivers a potent dose of 35 nutrients—including protein building blocks, electrolytes, and minerals—that supercharge skin cells with high energy. The result? Immediate visible results and long-term regenerative benefits.
With Biotech Plankton™, Biotherm delivers unparalleled skincare performance.

•3X stronger skin barrier function
•2X faster skin regeneration
•Amplified performance of other active ingredients by up to 5 times
30 years of research, 11 scientific publications, 6 live patents—and the potential is limitless.
After 30 years of biotech innovation, Biotherm continues to push the boundaries: In partnership with Carbios, the brand will launch the world's first bio-recycled plastic bottle. Three years in the making, this innovation will bring Biotherm closer to its goal of becoming fully plastic circular by 2030.
